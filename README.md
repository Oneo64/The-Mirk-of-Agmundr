# Overview
> The year is AD 922. To escape war, a northman suffering from PTSD is pressured by his brother to sail with him for a new land. After meeting the shore of the new land, he must overcome his disorders as they attempt to establish a farmstead without succumbing to the horrors that dwell there.

The Mirk of Agmundr, set in the early 10th century, is a true medieval fantasy story and worldbuilding project about two farmers-turned-vikings who sailed from Iceland to Newfoundland. It is built, developed, and written by Oneo64.

Many mythological aspects appear in this world, such as the presence of draugar (a magical revenant) and pagan magic.

The Mirk of Agmundr was originally a spinoff of Aldraheimr (link available below), but quickly became its own thing.
