Ljörn was a settler who traveled to a northern island under the command of Hjalvir.

## Appearance
Ljörn has shoulder-length, dark blond hair with gentle but messy waves. His hair is pulled back and then secured by a cloth strip tied around his head. He has a light stubble and fair skin. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior.

### Casual wear
When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He wears a baldric scabbard with a sword.[^1] He has a leather pouch and a small seax on his belt. Ljörn wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

### Traveling
When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield.

## Personality
Ljörn is reserved and slightly introverted. He does not speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, although he doesn't mind being in public (or crowded places). When he talks to strangers, he might make things awkward, but otherwise, he tries to be polite, especially to his elders or higher-ups. He is stubborn; he usually sticks to his decisions.

To strangers, Ljörn acts uncaring and unassertive, ignoring things that don't concern him. For example, if a thief stole something from someone he doesn't know, he'll ignore the commotion.

Ljörn doesn't have a good self-esteem. When he receives a compliment, he tends to downplay it or mutter a thanks. He doesn't think he's a good teacher.

When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he avoids using extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn's favorite food is venison. He keeps a small bag of dried strips in his pouch for later. His second favorite food is dried, hard bread with the crust because it's chewy.

### Voice
Ljörn doesn't speak much. When speaking to strangers, he tends to give one word answers. He speaks casually and informally, and sometimes he would grumble or mumble answers. Despite his casual and informal speech, he also speaks very directly, but never blunt. On top of that, he occasionally pauses between his speech.

 - "What do you mean?"
 - "I... don't think-"
 - "Alfrir. I-"
 - "Are your boots... wet, too?"
 - "How long will this travelling last?"
 - "What?"
 - "Yes."
 - "No."
 - "No. I told you I didn't. They... they smelled us here."

### Paranoia
Ljörn has PTSD. He seems fine most of the time, but sometimes, it shows. He avoids reading the story *Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni*, or any stories with undead in them.[^2]

Occasionally, Ljörn is reminded of his experience with the draugr and becomes paranoid, thinking he's been followed. He only calms down by forgetting it or knowing he's near a bundle of juniper needles[^3], though the thought still lingers.

If confronted about his behavior, Ljörn would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all. Although Alfrir noticed his behavior only once, Ljörn told him not to worry.

His PTSD is triggered by seeing sitting/moving corpses (or anything that looks like it), seeing silhouettes in the dark, seeing rusty weapons, seeing deep spaces like a dark cave or a deep ocean, being in dark forests, being in ruined castles, or hearing the word *draugr*.

### Rúna
Ljörn finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia.

### Goals
#### Goal arc A
**Goal:** To return to Álahringr.
**Motivation:** My family doesn't have a reliable protector.

#### Goal arc B
**Goal:** To survive.
**Motivation:** Successfulness.

### Arc
Positive Arc
FEAR -> REALISATION -> COURAGE
**Ghost:** Unresolved PTSD from the past.
**Lie:** I hate this land, I'm tired of adventure, and my family is in danger.
**Want:** I want to return back to Álahringr.
**Need:** I need to realise my visions aren't real because they only harm me.
**Truth:** I should stay, because right now I'm in greater danger than my family.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience from a previous adventure in the ruins of an old castle, where he fought draugar.

Because Ljörn was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a raid, his left arm was weakened.

### Rægatafl
Ljörn knows how to play Rægatafl, a local board game.

## Notes
[^1]: Ljörn's sword is a Peterson Type L sword.
[^2]: Before his adventure, Ljörn knew the story told in *Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni*. Yngvarr, a character in the story, died when a draugr knocked him over and slashed him. During Ljörn's trip to the castle ruin, a draugr knocked him over (like Yngvarr) and almost killed him. When he and his accomplices fled, the draugr chased them. Ljörn only thought they lost the draugr when he heard the forest was quiet during their camp for the night. That moment is where his odd behaviors come from.
[^3]: Juniper is a type of greater protection herb.
