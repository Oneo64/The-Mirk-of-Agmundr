Ljörn was a settler who travelled to a northern island under the command of Hjalvir. He is now a farmer. In his spare time, he cuts trees and makes firewood, and hunts deer, bringing his game home.

## Appearance
Ljörn has armpit-length, dark blond hair with gentle but messy waves. His hair is combed, pulled back, and then secured by a cloth strip tied around his head. He has a short, full beard, which makes his jawline look soft, and fair skin. His dark, pale blue eyes are hooded and downturned, making him seem sad or tired to many people. He has an ottermode build and stands at a height of 5'9".

### Casual wear
When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He wears a baldric scabbard with a sword.[^1] He has a leather pouch and a small seax on his belt. Ljörn wears a Mjöllnir amulet.

### Traveling
When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield.

## Personality
Ljörn is reserved and slightly introverted. He does not speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, although he doesn't mind being in public (or crowded places). When he talks to strangers, he might make things awkward, but otherwise, he tries to be polite, especially to his elders or higher-ups. He is stubborn; he usually sticks to his decisions.

Ljörn doesn't have a good self-esteem. When he receives a compliment, he tends to downplay it or mutter a thanks. He doesn't think he's a good teacher.

When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he avoids using extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn's favorite food is venison. He keeps a small bag of dried strips in his pouch for later. His second favorite food is dried, hard bread with the crust because it's chewy.

### Voice
Ljörn doesn't speak much. When speaking to strangers, he tends to give one word answers. He speaks casually and informally, and sometimes he would grumble or mumble answers. Despite his casual and informal speech, he also speaks very directly, but never bluntly. If he does bluntly blurt something out, he only does it rarely when he's surprised. On top of that, he occasionally pauses between his speech. *(See Voice Examples below to see examples of how he speaks.)*

### PTSD
Ljörn has PTSD. He seems fine most of the time, but sometimes, it shows. His PTSD is triggered by seeing silhouettes in the dark, hearing shouting/grunts from pain, hearing loud horns, hearing metals hitting each other, or lying on his back while someone is standing in front of him. Sometimes, he might think he saw movement in the shadows and get paranoid. He would especially ignore confronting robbers or thieves, unless he were the victim. Additionally, he has trouble sleeping at night, afraid he might wake up to a fight again, and he also gets nightmares of his past experiences. Sometimes, Ljörn has anger outbursts, although he tries to control or suppress himself.

If confronted about his behaviour, Ljörn would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all. Although Alfrir noticed his behaviour only once, Ljörn told him not to worry.

### Rúna
Ljörn finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia.

When it comes to physical closeness, Ljörn becomes very shy. Since he is the second-born son of his family and is introverted, he doesn't get as many hugs as his other siblings. He also stopped receiving any after arriving in Newfoundland. Because of this, he cherishes bold gestures with Rúna, such as long hugs and hand-holding. He doesn't mind sitting very close together for prolonged periods, but he would never initiate it because he isn't used to doing that.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience.

Because Ljörn was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a raid, his left arm was weakened.

### Hunting
Ljörn can hunt deer. He hunts by throwing his spear at prey, aiming for the shoulder or flank.

Ljörn knows how to play Rægtafl, but he isn't the best at it.
