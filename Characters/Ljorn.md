Ljörn was a settler who traveled to a northern island under the command of Hjalvir.

## Appearance
Ljörn has shoulder-length, dark blond hair with gentle but messy waves. His hair is pulled back and then secured by a cloth strip tied around his head. He has a light stubble and fair skin. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior.

### Casual wear
When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He wears a baldric scabbard with a sword.[^1] He has a leather pouch and a small seax on his belt. Ljörn wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

### Traveling
When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield.

## Personality
Ljörn is reserved and slightly introverted. He does not speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, although he doesn't mind being in public (or crowded places). When he talks to strangers, he might make things awkward, but otherwise, he tries to be polite, especially to his elders or higher-ups. He is stubborn; he usually sticks to his decisions.

Ljörn doesn't have a good self-esteem. When he receives a compliment, he tends to downplay it or mutter a thanks. He doesn't think he's a good teacher.

When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he avoids using extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn's favorite food is venison. He keeps a small bag of dried strips in his pouch for later. His second favorite food is dried, hard bread with the crust because it's chewy.

### Voice
Ljörn doesn't speak much. When speaking to strangers, he tends to give one word answers. He speaks casually and informally, and sometimes he would grumble or mumble answers. Despite his casual and informal speech, he also speaks very directly, but never bluntly. If he does bluntly blurt something out, he only does it rarely when he's surprised. On top of that, he occasionally pauses between his speech.

 - "What do you mean?"
 - "I... don't think-"
 - "Alfrir. I-"
 - "Are your boots... wet, too?"
 - "How long will this travelling last?"
 - "What?"
 - "Yes."
 - "No."
 - "I am not an outlaw. They smelled us here!"
 - "Nightmare."
 - "Get off me."

### PTSD
Ljörn has PTSD. He seems fine most of the time, but sometimes, it shows. His PTSD is triggered by seeing silhouettes in the dark, hearing shouting/grunts from pain, hearing loud horns, hearing metals hitting each other, or lying on his back while someone is standing in front of him. Sometimes, he might think he saw movement in the shadows and get paranoid. He would especially ignore confronting robbers or thieves, unless he were the victim. Additionally, he has trouble sleeping at night, afraid he might wake up to a fight again. Sometimes, Ljörn has anger outbursts, although he tries to control or suppress himself.

If confronted about his behaviour, Ljörn would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all. Although Alfrir noticed his behaviour only once, Ljörn told him not to worry.

### Rúna
Ljörn finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia.

### Goals
#### Goal arc A
 - **Goal:** To return to Álahringr.
 - **Motivation:** My family doesn't have a reliable protector.

#### Goal arc B
 - **Goal:** To survive.
 - **Motivation:** Successfulness.

### Arc
 - Positive Arc
 - FEAR -> REALISATION -> COURAGE
 - **Ghost:** Unresolved PTSD from the past.
 - **Lie:** I hate this land, I'm tired of adventure, and my family is in danger.
 - **Want:** I want to return back to Álahringr.
 - **Need:** I need to realise my visions aren't real because they only harm me.
 - **Truth:** I should stay, because right now I'm in greater danger than my family.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience.

Because Ljörn was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a raid, his left arm was weakened.

### Rægatafl
Ljörn knows how to play Rægatafl, a local board game.
