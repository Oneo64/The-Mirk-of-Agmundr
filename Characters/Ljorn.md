</tbody></table>

Ljörn was a settler who travelled to a northern island under the command of Hjalvir. He is now a farmer. In his spare time, he cuts trees and makes firewood, and hunts deer, bringing his game home.

## Appearance
Ljörn has armpit-length, dark blond hair with gentle but messy waves, often described as looking like old, darkened, and dry wheat. His hair is combed, pulled back, and then secured by a cloth strip tied around his head. He has a short, full beard, which makes his jawline look soft, and fair skin. His dark, pale blue eyes are hooded and downturned, making him seem sad or tired to many people. He has an ottermode build and stands at a height of 5'9".

Ljörn has three prominent scars on his body: two on both of his knees from a falling accident, and one on his left shoulder from an arrow shot.

When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woollen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He wears a baldric scabbard with a sword.[^1] He has a leather pouch and a small seax on his belt. Ljörn wears a Mjöllnir amulet.

When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and short byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield.

## Personality
On the surface, Ljörn is reserved, slightly introverted, and seems fairly and normally casual without closing his emotions off in an ice-cold box. He does not speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, although he doesn't mind being in public (or crowded places). He also has a keen survival instinct, being able to quickly and accordingly act on what to do to survive in stressful or urgent situations.

Although strangers describe Ljörn as an unfriendly person due to his reservedness and maturity, he tries to be polite whenever possible, saying necessary things such as sorry or excuse me, and bowing his head, especially to his elders or superiors. He is stubborn; he usually sticks to his decisions.

Ljörn doesn't have good self-esteem. When he receives a compliment, he tends to downplay it or mumble a thanks. He doesn't think he's a good teacher even after someone has learned something valuable from him.
When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he avoids using extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn has a love-hate relationship with his sword. Even though he carries it around with him and is willing to use it in self-defence, it reminds him of his dead older brother. To cope, he lies to himself that it was given to him directly by his father.

In a lot of situations, Ljörn seeks peace and doesn't really like war or heated arguments. Despite this, he carries his weapons. And surprisingly, his death wish, unadmittedly, is to die in a planned battle before he succumbs to age.

Ljörn has several notable habits, such as using sticks (or sometimes, the end of his spear) to draw and fiddle with dirt, crossing his fingers when in a relaxed position, or sometimes talking to himself with mostly short phrases. When nervous, he caresses the right side of his neck. His favourite food is venison, a meat he will devour if cooked well. His second favourite food is dried, hard bread with the crust because it's chewy.

Outside safe spaces, it is exceedingly hard to make Ljörn genuinely smile for more than a few seconds. He rarely laughs out loud, as most of his laughs are subdued snorts of air or whispered chuckling.

### Voice
Ljörn speaks informally and not much, often answering people with one or two words. During his shy moments, he mutters or grumbles his words, and sometimes stammers. Despite his casualness, he also speaks as directly as possible. Unless he is startled, he never blurts out his words. *(See Example Dialogues below to see examples of how he speaks.)*

Ljörn's natural voice is lukewarm and has a gravelly texture, but it has a cold tone, like the sound of a warm, murky rainstorm. When he is tired, his voice becomes slightly hoarse.

### PTSD
Ljörn has PTSD. Although he seems fine most of the time, he has triggers relating to his traumatic experiences. Some triggers, but not all, are: silhouettes in the dark, large amounts of wood burning (like a burning pole), and hostile or fighting sounds.

His outward demeanour when not having an episode is also affected. He has trouble forming any meaningful connections and would ignore confronting robbers or thieves, unless he were the victim. Additionally, he has trouble sleeping at night, afraid he might wake up to a fight again, and he also gets nightmares of his past experiences.

During an episode, Ljörn has anger outbursts, although he tries to control or suppress himself. After the episode subsides and he has gotten himself alone, he would cry soundlessly for a while before pulling himself together.

Most of the time, when Ljörn is confronted about his behaviour, he would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all, like when he told Álfr not to worry when he noticed his behaviour. When he is left alone with Rúna, he is willing to spill his troubles with her.

After leaving Iceland for Agmundaland, Ljörn was still afraid of several things. He feared for the safety of his father, mother, and sister. He was also greatly worried that going there wouldn't do much good for peace, but went anyway. His symptoms have subsided now, but he still gets them. *(He will never fully recover. Probably.)*

#### Source of PTSD:
 - Sudden raid by Norwegian Vikings during nighttime (was shaken awake from sleep to deal with this tragedy):
   - Almost got hit by a falling, blazing beam while inside a burning house (not his)
   - Never saw Kolr again after his (Kolr's) house burned down, even though they were only acquaintances
   - Watched Úlfnir get brutally slain
   - Witnessed a foe raise a battleaxe over him after being shot and collapsed by an arrow
 - Struggles of settlement in Agmundaland (Newfoundland):
   - Got haunted by an angry draugr who had supernatural powers
   - Got lost in the forest
   - Had a miserable week-long trip sailing to Agmundaland, even though it was just wet boots, cold weather, and bad food compared to the raid
   - Settlement attacked by trolls, reinforcing paranoia

### Rúna
[*See: Rúna.md*](Runa.md)

Ljörn finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia. He thinks of her as having the most soothing voice in the world, even though it's subjective and that he would never actually say so while sober. He cherishes physical touch and acts of service the most.

When it comes to physical closeness and strong, affectionate words, Ljörn becomes very shy and melts. Since he is the second-born son in his family and introverted, he doesn't receive as many hugs or compliments as his other siblings. He also stopped receiving any after arriving in Newfoundland. Because of this, he cherishes bold gestures with Rúna, such as long hugs and hand-holding. He doesn't mind sitting very close together for prolonged periods, but he would never initiate it because he isn't used to doing that.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience from several encounters, including a draugr, a wild bear, and two Norwegian Vikings.

Ljörn's left arm is weak because of an arrow injury during a raid on his home village. He can hold his shield up fine, but he is more tired from taking blows.

### Hunting
Ljörn can hunt deer. He usually goes into the forest to find them.

Once Ljörn spots a deer and gets within a comfortable range, he first injures them by throwing his spear at the prey, aiming for the shoulder or flank, then finishes them off with his seax. He also knows how to skin them for their hides.

Because of his hunting skill, Ljörn is also good at moving stealthily, especially in forest terrain.

## Lore
Ljörn was born on December 2nd in Álahringr, a south-western village in Iceland. It was next to a forest and a river that flowed directly into the ocean. During his childhood, he would often go into the forest to explore and play sword-fighting with Álfr and Úlfnir, using sticks as mock swords and spears. There was one time when he wasn't careful while going down a rough hill with both of his brothers, and he fell, putting a permanent scar on both knees.

Ljörn also found that he wasn't quite fond of flowers' smells, as they made his nose scrunch up every time he tried to smell them.

When he was alone, he would sneak into Kolr's workplace, who was his neighbour and also the blacksmith of the village, just to see what was in there and mess around with his tools. During winter, he sometimes would throw snowballs at the cows of local farmers. But this time, he was actually caught and was scolded by the cows' owner.

However, he started to become quieter, reserved, and more mature with age, not wanting to play pretend anymore and instead playing Rægtafl (a strategic 2-player board game) with family.

In his late teens, he began to show interest in hunting and was taken out to the wilderness by his father to learn how to hunt, first learning how to hunt deer. He was taught how to throw a spear and use it with a shield. Later, he would go out by himself and hunt down a deer all by himself.

One day, when he was taking a leisurely stroll in the forest, he saw a pretty girl by the river (who was Rúna) and got a short-lived crush, but he slowly forgot about her as he only saw her silhouette. On this day, he cannot remember much about this interaction, including appearance and location, other than that he had a fleeting crush on someone.

Ljörn witnessed his father, who was getting too old to fight, pass his sword to Úlfnir, who proudly carried it in public whenever he could.

During the night of his twenty-fourth summer, he was suddenly woken to a violent raid of Vikings from Norway. After preparing his armour, he went out with his spear and shield. The first thing he saw was Kolr's home being set on fire by someone. He rushed into the home to see nothing but a suffocating, smouldering wooden structure with no one in it. As he searched, a flaming beam broke and fell, almost crashing onto him. After leaving, he and Álfr both fended off an adversary. Then, he saw Úlfnir attack an armoured warrior near the center of the village, and as he watched, another came up to his brother's side and planted an axe into his neck.

Then, he was assailed by two men at once, one was armoured from head to toe in maille with a masked helmet and a Dane axe, the other with a bow. The bowman was already aiming at him. He raised his shield, but the arrow went straight through his shield and struck his left arm.

Ljörn was pressed backward as the warrior came closer. He raised his shield again, just in time for it to be struck into deformation and away from his hand, landing onto the ground, useless.

When the barbarian let his axe fly towards Ljörn, he tried to block it with his spear. But his spear was broken in half, and he tripped over a small indent in the ground. He landed on his behind and scooted backwards as the armoured foe raised his axe. But just as he was about to let it fall onto him, Álfr charged into his executioner and delayed the strike.

Ljörn scrambled to his feet, grabbed the half of the broken spear with the spearhead, and went into the forest to hide there until the raiders left. After the raid, Ljörn returned and got his arrow taken out and treated. Now, being the oldest living son of his father, he was given Úlfnir's sword.

Ever since the raid, he had been introverted. He would get nightmares if he could sleep, couldn't look at Dane axes or any axe on a long shaft, and would jump at the sound of creaking wood. As for Úlfnir and his sword, he wouldn't dare to think his sword was from his brother and lies to himself that it was given to him directly by his father.
