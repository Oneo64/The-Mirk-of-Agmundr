Ljörn was a settler who travelled to a northern island under the command of Hjalvir. He is now a farmer. In his spare time, he cuts trees and makes firewood, and hunts deer, bringing his game home.

## Appearance
Ljörn has armpit-length, dark blond hair with gentle but messy waves. His hair is combed, pulled back, and then secured by a cloth strip tied around his head. He has a short, full beard, which makes his jawline look soft, and fair skin. His dark, pale blue eyes are hooded and downturned, making him seem sad or tired to many people. He has an ottermode build and stands at a height of 5'9".

### Casual wear
When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He wears a baldric scabbard with a sword.[^1] He has a leather pouch and a small seax on his belt. Ljörn wears a Mjöllnir amulet.

### Traveling
When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield.

## Personality
Ljörn is reserved and slightly introverted. He does not speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, although he doesn't mind being in public (or crowded places). When he talks to strangers, he might make things awkward, but otherwise, he tries to be polite, especially to his elders or higher-ups. He is stubborn; he usually sticks to his decisions.

Ljörn doesn't have good self-esteem. When he receives a compliment, he tends to downplay it or mutter a thanks. He doesn't think he's a good teacher.

When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he avoids using extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn's favourite food is venison. He keeps a small bag of dried strips in his pouch for later. His second favourite food is dried, hard bread with the crust because it's chewy.

### Voice
Ljörn speaks informally. He doesn't talk a lot, often answering people with one or two words. During his shy moments, he mutters or sometimes even grumbles. Despite his casualness, he also speaks as directly as possible. Unless he is startled, he never blurts out his words. *(See Example Dialogues below to see examples of how he speaks.)*

Ljörn's natural voice has a lukewarm and gravelly texture, but it has a cold tone, like the sound of a warm, murky rainstorm. When he is tired, his voice becomes slightly hoarse.

### PTSD
Ljörn has PTSD. He seems fine most of the time, but sometimes, it shows. His PTSD is triggered by seeing silhouettes in the dark, hearing shouting/grunts from pain, hearing loud horns, hearing metals hitting each other, or lying on his back while someone is standing in front of him. Sometimes, he might think he saw movement in the shadows and get paranoid. He would especially ignore confronting robbers or thieves, unless he were the victim. Additionally, he has trouble sleeping at night, afraid he might wake up to a fight again, and he also gets nightmares of his past experiences. Sometimes, Ljörn has anger outbursts, although he tries to control or suppress himself.

If confronted about his behaviour, Ljörn would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all. Although Alfrir noticed his behaviour only once, Ljörn told him not to worry.

#### Source of PTSD:
 - Sudden raid by Norwegian Vikings during nighttime (was shaken awake from sleep to deal with this tragedy):
   - Almost got hit by a falling, blazing beam while inside a burning house (not his)
   - Never saw Kolr again after his (Kolr's) house burned down, even though they were only acquaintances
   - Witnessed a foe raise a battleaxe over him after being shot and collapsed by an arrow
 - Struggles of settlement in Agmundaland (Newfoundland):
   - Got haunted by an angry draugr who had supernatural powers
   - Got lost in the forest
   - Had a miserable week-long trip sailing to Agmundaland, even though it was just wet boots, cold weather, and bad food compared to the raid
   - Settlement attacked by trolls, reinforcing paranoia

### Rúna
[*See: Rúna.md*](Runa.md)

Ljörn finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia. He thinks her as having the most soothing voice in the world, even though it's subjective and that he would never actually say so while sober. He cherishes physical touch and acts of service the most.

When it comes to physical closeness and strong, affectionate words, Ljörn becomes very shy and melts. Since he is the second-born son in his family and introverted, he doesn't receive as many hugs or compliments as his other siblings. He also stopped receiving any after arriving in Newfoundland. Because of this, he cherishes bold gestures with Rúna, such as long hugs and hand-holding. He doesn't mind sitting very close together for prolonged periods, but he would never initiate it because he isn't used to doing that.

### Arc

 - FEAR &rarr; REALISATION &rarr; COURAGE

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience from several encounters, including a draugr, a wild bear, and two Norwegian Vikings.

Ljörn's left arm is weak because of an arrow injury during a raid on his home village. He can hold his shield up fine, but he is more tired from taking blows.

### Hunting
Ljörn can hunt deer. He usually goes into the forest to find them.

Once Ljörn spots a deer and gets within a comfortable range, he first injures them by throwing his spear at the prey, aiming for the shoulder or flank, then finishes them off with his seax. He also knows how to skin them for their hides.

Because of his hunting skill, Ljörn is also good at moving stealthily, especially in forest terrain.

### Tree-climbing
Ljörn once climbed a tree in an attempt to escape a bear.

### Rægtafl
Ljörn knows how to play Rægtafl, but he isn't the best at it.
