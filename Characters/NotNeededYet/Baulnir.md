Baulnir is a human from Óssvík. When his father takes his boat to trade, Baulnir usually goes with him to guard the boat.

## Appearance
Baulnir has fair skin, which is slightly tanned, brown eyes, and light brown hair. He wears a grey woolen cap, a muted aqua (blueish green) tunic, a pair of brown pants, and a pair of leather shoes. He carries a Viking sword in its scabbard, held by a baldric.[^1] He wears an iron Talmundúr amulet.

### Travelling
While traveling or going into combat, Baulnir wears his dark brown cloak and carries his round shield that's painted brown with a white cross. He also wears a magical leather nasal helmet, which grants him a slight darkvision when worn.

## Personality
Baulnir is protective of his family and may feel protective of people he sees as morally good and vulnerable. However, he can be arrogant, thinking his fighting is better than it is.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Many years ago, he gained some experience from raiding a castle ruin with his sister and another three warriors from Álahringr. Later, he gained some more from defending his home village from a bandit raid.

He sports a sword and shield, since he practiced it over the past four years.

### Languages
Baulnir can speak Oddarish, and because of trading, he picked up some Centrumic (English). Still, he isn't fluent in Centrumic.

## Notes
[^1]: Baulnir's sword is a Peterson Type U sword.
