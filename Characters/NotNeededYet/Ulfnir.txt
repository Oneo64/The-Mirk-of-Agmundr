[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ulfnir is a human from Álahringr. He has brown eyes, fair skin, and wavy shoulder-length brown hair, with a slight beard.

He wears a brown cap, a muted yellow tunic, gray pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. He also wears an iron Talmundúr amulet, and a bronze ring on his right middle finger. He is 178 (5'10) centimeters tall. He has a spear and a longbow.

Ulfnir can usually be found either felling trees with Alfrir, sparring with wooden spears, or taking care of farm animals. Sometimes he goes into the forest to hunt deer.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Ulfnir is a stern and responseful man, and usually acts serious. He doesn't really like being messed with. Still, he has a hard time deciding on anything outside following rules and usually lets other people decide for him.

Because Mifrún, his mother, would care for him as if he was still young, Ulfnir might get annoyed when someone tries to guide him something he already knows.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ulfnir has some very minor combat experience, gained from defending his family's home from a centaur a few years ago. He sports a spear, and taught himself archery. As of now he still isn't very good at hunting, since sometimes deer would notice him before he gets a chance to fire any arrows at them.

Ulfnir only understands Oddarish.
