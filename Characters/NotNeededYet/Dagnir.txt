Dagnir

Male
Age: Mid 30s
Alignment: Neutral

Homeland:  Álahringr, Oddarsveldi
Race:      Human



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Dagnir has long black wavy hair, a full messy beard, and dark eyes. His nose is pointed and crooked. He lives in the western area of Álahringr.

He wears a dark brown cloak, a dark yellow tunic, dark pants, a belt, and a pair of shoes. He carries a woodcutting axe and a sheathed seax on his belt. Despite being from the lower working class, Dagnir's breath almost never has the smell of alchohol as strong as others, since he drinks straight from the freshwater river.

At his house, he has a carrot farm.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Dagnir is devious and sometimes reckless, yet shows cowardice to things he doesn't understand (like magic) or people with political power. Despite his cowardice, he doesn't fear small insects like centipedes or roaches, and would pick them up and throw them away if needed. Since he goes around the village daily, he knows almost every rumor that has been going around the village. He is also the sort of person to engage in gossip. And lastly, he doesn't flirt, but he doesn't discourage it.

There is currently a running gag where Dagnir is Hersir Randúlfr's spy. Even Dagnir has embraced the gag and would play along just to mess with people, or to make himself seem significant.



[[ABILITIES]]
Dagnir is proficient in stealth, gained from sneaking around at night. He can also swim well, even if he has something weighing him down. He can also throw knives and get them to land on a wall if he's standing at the same distance away as when he practices.
