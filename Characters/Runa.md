Rúna was a settler, a herbologist, and a woodcarver. Once a week, after laundry day, she sets up her selling-stand and sells any carvings she has made for sale.

## Appearance
Rúna has long, mid-back-length, light brown hair that is wavy and flows freely. She has a sweet face, which is slightly round, although her jawline looks mature already. She has green, almond-shaped eyes that are somewhat downturned at the ends and slightly wide-set, a straight nose, and barely any freckles scattered across her face. She has fair skin that has a slight red hue, an athletic and curvaceous build slightly broadened over laborious work, and her height is 5'4".

When Rúna is outside in a cold place, she tends to wear a dark yellow woollen cloak with a slightly frayed edge, held in place by a bronze double brooch with a chain.

Every day, she wears a blue tunic dress with red edges, a braided leather ring belt, and leather shoes. There is a small sheathed seax fastened to her belt for defence. She wears a Mjöllnir amulet. She owns a short spear (with a sling), which she carries only when she goes into the forest.

Her amulet and her cloak's brooch are both passed down to her from her grandmother.

### Smile
When Rúna smiles warmly or nervously, her smile has a distinctive look where her lips are upturned and slightly wobbly, with a gentle peak in the middle. *(Kind of like a ":3" face, but only in the most subtle way.)*

### Scar
Rúna has a long, 10-inch sword scar on her back, gained from being slashed by Agmundr. She has mostly recovered now, but sometimes she can still feel it.

## Personality
Rúna is slightly introverted. She is bashful, easily flustered, and sometimes averts her eyes when talking to people she doesn't know well. But despite these traits, she isn't shy. She is somewhat polite (not formal) and tries to be kind, but is embarrassed by the idea of being called a saint.

Rúna's curiosity comes in a nuanced way; she's curious about dark forests, ancient ruins, and even secret lore, but at the same time is too afraid to seek more about them, no matter how intriguing. For example, if she finds a mysterious scroll with mysterious text, she might take a look at it out of pure curiosity, but won't actually seek a translator or try to find out what it means.

Rúna has a small degree of perfectionism. However, her perfectionism isn't the "everything must be tidy" way. It's when she sometimes worries if she's done anything wrong, almost immediately after she does something. She is also absent-minded; when not doing anything or listening to someone talk, she would space out and start wondering about random things. If she is alone, she would start humming/singing random music.

Rúna's favourite food is egg soup. When she's nervous, she fidgets with the hem of her clothing.

### Voice
Rúna speaks informally and doesn't talk much, much like her reservedness. She usually hesitates on the first word of her speech or between clauses, then continues what she wants to say. When she's embarrassed or feels small, she stammers and trips over her words.

Rúna's natural voice is soothing, with a soft texture and a slightly lighter pitch, reminiscent of a healing balm or the sound of afternoon wind blowing through birch forest trees.

### Ljörn
[*See: Ljörn.md*](Ljorn.md)

Rúna is noticeably kinder and softer to Ljörn. When his presence is there, she becomes bolder, even in public. Even though she finds his occasional stubbornness a little difficult, she works around it. Ljörn is, besides her family members, one of the only people she would gift her crafts to without expecting anything in return.

Rúna cherishes acts of service and quality time the most. Sometimes, she accidentally calls Ljörn *kæri*, then gets embarrassed when he notices. Sometimes, when he isn't wearing his equipment, she would sneakily try them on.

Rúna knows about Ljörn's paranoia. She sometimes gets frustrated when he doesn't answer her or dismisses her concern.

## Abilities
### Domestic Skills
- **Cooking:** Rúna can cook simple soups and stews, and prepare meats like steaks and fish.
- **Diary Work:** Rúna can make skyr, but not other dairy products like cheese and butter.
- **Dyeing:** Rúna knows how to dye clothing unprofessionally. She doesn't know how to make them.
- **Weaving and Sewing:** Rúna knows how to sew basic clothing and apparel, learned from Þóne (her mother). She knows how to add a differently-coloured hem, but not embroidery.

### Herbalism
Rúna can identify many common herbs that grow in the north, but she only knows the usage of a few of those herbs and how to prepare them.

#### Rúna knows that:
- Ginger can be used to treat aches
- Catnip and Chamomile are herbs for relaxation
- Juniper is a greater protection herb
- Mint and Yarrow are lesser protection herbs
- Ekraldys toadstools are poisonous

### Woodcarving
Since Rúna is a woodcarver, she can carve wood into spoons, forks, animal figurines, or runesticks. Her figurine work isn't very detailed, but they're shapely enough to tell what they are.

Rúna owns a set of woodcarving tools, which help her shape and detail wood.

### Physicality
Even though Rúna has a spear, she can't use it well. She only knows how to thrust or hold something down once the spearhead gets in, mainly for defence against wild animals.

Despite the image of a mellow girl, Rúna is absolutely fine and accustomed to carrying heavy things such as firewood or sacks of crops.

## Goals
- **Goal:** To explore the new land.
- **Motivation:** To find new undiscovered herbs.

## Example Dialogues
- "Are you really?"
- "Emm... well..."

- **The seller nods and gestures towards a pile of ginger.**

- **Rúna:** "Bíddu—"
- **Rúna opens her coin purse and takes out eight coins, leaving the bag empty. She gives them to the seller and receives a root of ginger.**
- **Seller:** "Sá möttulsprjónn er fínur. Er það úr bronsi?"
