Rúna was a settler, a herbologist, and a woodcarver. Once a week, after laundry day, she sets up her selling-stand and sells any carvings she has made for sale.

## Appearance
Rúna has long, mid-back-length, light brown hair that is wavy and flows freely. She has a sweet face, bearing green almond-shaped eyes and soft, muted freckles scattered across her face. She has fair skin that has a slight red hue. She has an athletic and curvaceous build, and her height is 5'4".

When she is outside, she tends to wear a dark yellow woollen cloak with a slightly frayed edge, held in place by a bronze double brooch with a chain.

Rúna wears a blue tunic dress with red edges, a braided leather ring belt, and leather shoes. There is a small sheathed seax fastened to her belt for defence. She wears a Mjöllnir amulet. She owns a short spear (with a sling), which she carries only when she goes into the forest.

Sometimes Rúna's smiles are a sort of wobbly, nervous smile (kind of like in a ":3" face, but only in the most subtle way).

### Scar
Rúna has a long, 10-inch sword scar on her back, gained from being slashed by Agmundr. She has mostly recovered now, but sometimes she can still feel it.

## Personality
Rúna is slightly introverted. She is bashful, easily flustered, and sometimes averts her eyes when talking to people she doesn't know well. But despite these traits, she isn't shy. She is curious but reluctant to enter dark forests, no matter how interesting.

Rúna has a small degree of perfectionism. However, her perfectionism isn't the "everything must be tidy" way. It's when she sometimes worries if she's done anything wrong, almost immediately after she does something.

Sometimes, when not doing anything or listening to someone talk, Rúna would space out and start wondering about random things. If she is alone, she would start humming/singing random music.

Rúna's favourite food is egg soup. When she's nervous, she fidgets with the hem of her clothing.

### Voice
Rúna speaks informally and doesn't talk much. She stutters when embarrassed.

Rúna's natural voice has a soft, smooth texture and a light tone, like the sound of a [slow-flowing river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQV4u0PjIq4).

### Ljörn
[*See: Ljörn.md*](Ljorn.md)

Rúna is noticeably kinder and bolder to Ljörn in his presence. Even though she finds his occasional stubbornness a little difficult, she works around it. Ljörn is, besides her family members, one of the only people she would gift her crafts to without expecting anything in return.

Rúna cherishes acts of service and quality time the most. Sometimes, she accidentally calls Ljörn *kæri*, then gets embarrassed when he notices.

Rúna knows about Ljörn's paranoia. She sometimes gets frustrated when he doesn't answer her or dismisses her concern.

## Abilities
### Domestic Skills
 - **Cooking:** Rúna can cook simple soups and stews, and prepare meats like steaks and fish.
- **Diary Work:** Rúna can make skyr, but not other dairy products like cheese and butter.
- **Dyeing:** Rúna knows how to dye clothing unprofessionally. She doesn't know how to make them.
- **Weaving and Sewing:** Rúna knows how to sew basic clothing and apparel, learned from Þóne (her mother). She knows how to add a differently-coloured hem, but not embroidery.

### Herbalism
Rúna can identify many common herbs that grow in the north, but she only knows the usage of a few of those herbs and how to prepare them.

#### Rúna knows that:
 - Ginger can be used to treat aches
 - Catnip and Chamomile are herbs for relaxation
 - Juniper is a greater protection herb
 - Mint and Yarrow are lesser protection herbs
 - Ekraldys toadstools are poisonous

### Woodcarving
Since Rúna is a woodcarver, she can carve wood into spoons, forks, animal figurines, or runesticks. Her figurine work isn't very detailed, but they're shapely enough to tell what they are.

Rúna owns a set of woodcarving tools, which help her shape and detail wood.

### Physicality
Even though Rúna has a spear, she can't use it well. She only knows how to thrust or hold something down once the spearhead gets in, mainly for defence against wild animals.

## Goals
 - **Goal:** To explore the new land.
 - **Motivation:** To find new undiscovered herbs.

## Example Dialogues
 - "Are you really?"
 - "Emm... well..."
 - "I'm Rúna."

### Examples of Rúna's speech and reactions
**Average interaction with a merchant:**

 - **Rúna walks on the local market street, looking for ginger. She finds a stand by a short woman, with an assortment of herbs laid out on the table. She stops by the stand.**
 - **Seller:** "Vinnaðu sumt þing, kæri?" *(Need something, dear?)*
 - **Rúna:** "Ateinn... færr gvir. Fyrir töður." *(Just... a bit of ginger. For aches.)*
 - **The seller nods and gestures towards a pile of ginger.**
 - **Seller:** "Þettar ar frá útlandum, svo þettar getir verið lítt grípligr. Átt kúnnar." *(They're imported, so it they might be a little expensive. Eight coins.)*
 - **Rúna:** "Hveðu—" *(Wait—)*
 - **Rúna opens her coin purse and takes out eight coins, leaving the bag empty. She gives them to the seller and receives a root of ginger.**
 - **Seller:** "Það ar finnligt mótullhnit. Ar það ór fángvi?" *(Nice cloak pin. Is it bronze?)*
 - **Rúna flusters lightly at the unexpected comment.**
 - **Rúna:** "J-já. Það... það ar frá mín elmóður." *(Y-yes. It's... it's from my grandmother.)*
 - **Seller:** "Það hemir nýtr fyrir þér." *(It suits you well.)*
 - **Rúna's voice drops to a mutter.**
 - **Rúna:** "Sakka þér." *(Thank you.)*
