Rúna was a settler, a herbologist, and a woodcarver.

## Appearance
Rúna has long, armpit-length, light brown hair that is wavy and flows freely. Her almond eyes are large and pale green, and her skin is pale with a slight reddish hue, with soft freckles scattered across her face. She is slim and curvaceous, and her height is 5'4".

When she is outside, she tends to wear a dark yellow woolen cloak with a slightly frayed edge, held by a bronze double brooch with a chain. She casually wears a simple, muted blue calf-length tunic, a braided leather ring belt, and leather shoes. On her belt, there is a small sheathed seax for defense. She wears a necklace with an iron Talmundúr amulet. She owns a short spear (with a sling), which she carries only when she goes into the forest.

## Personality
Rúna is slightly introverted. She is bashful, easily flustered, and sometimes averts her eyes when talking to people she doesn't know well. But despite these traits, she isn't shy. She is curious, but she is reluctant to enter dark forests no matter how interesting it is.

Rúna has a small degree of perfectionism. However, her perfectionism isn't the "everything must be tidy" way. It's when she sometimes worries if she's done anything wrong, almost immediately after she does something.

Sometimes, when not doing anything or listening to someone talk, Rúna would space out and start wondering about random things.

Rúna's favorite food is roasted potatoes, especially those with salt. When she's nervous, she fidgets with the hem of her clothing.

### Voice
Rúna speaks informally with a slight stutter.

 - "Are you really?"
 - "Emm... well..."
 - "I'm Rúna."

### Ljörn
Rúna is noticeably kinder to Ljörn in his presence. Even though she finds his occasional stubbornness a little difficult, she works around it. Ljörn is, besides her family members, one of the only people she would gift her crafts to without expecting anything in return.

Rúna knows about Ljörn's paranoia. She sometimes gets frustrated when he doesn't answer her or dismisses her concern.

Rúna would sometimes accidentally call Ljörn *kæri*, then get embarrased when he notices.

### Goals
**Goal:** To explore the new land.
**Motivation:** To find new undiscovered herbs.

## Abilities
### Arts and Crafts
Since Rúna is a woodcarver, she can carve wood into spoons, forks, animal figurines, or runesticks. Her figurine work isn't very detailed, but they're shapely enough to tell what they are.

Rúna has a set of woodcarving tools, which help her shape and detail wood.

### Herbalism
Rúna is a herbalist and can identify many common herbs that grow in the north. However, she only knows the usage of a few plants.

**Rúna knows that:**

 - Ginger can be used to treat aches
 - Catnip and Chamomile is a herb for relaxation
 - Juniper is a greater protection herb
 - Mint and Yarrow are lesser protection herbs
 - Ekraldys toadstools are poisonous

### Lyre
Rúna can play the lyre; however, she isn't brave enough to play it in the presence of strangers.

Rúna only knows one music piece, which she made when it drifted into her mind. She called it *Skáldstrúa*, which literally just means bard's beliefs.

### Physicality
Even though Rúna has a spear, she can't use it well. She only knows how to thrust or hold something down once the spearhead gets in, mainly for defense against wild animals.

## Examples of Rúna's speech and reactions
**Average interaction with a merchant:**

 - **Rúna walks on the local market street, looking for ginger. She finds a stand by a short woman, with an assortment of herbs laid out on the table. She stops by the stand.**
 - **Seller:** "Vorna summ, kæri?" *(Need something, dear?)*
 - **Rúna:** "Ött... færr zin. Fyrir tyður." *(Just... a bit of ginger. For aches.)*
 - **The seller nods and gestures towards a pile of ginger.**
 - **Seller:** "Þessir ar frá útlandr, svo þessir mændu ar lítt grípligt. Átt kúnnir." *(They're imported, so it they might be a little expensive. Eight coins.)*
 - **Rúna:** "Hvöð-" *(Wait-)*
 - **Rúna opens her coin purse and takes out eight coins, leaving the bag empty. She gives them to the seller and receives a root of ginger.**
 - **Seller:** "Finnligt mótullhnititt. Ar það fángva?" *(Nice cloak pin. Is it bronze?)*
 - **Rúna flusters lightly at the unexpected comment.**
 - **Rúna:** "J-já. Það... það ar frá minn ellrimöðriss." *(Y-yes. It's... it's from my grandmother.)*
 - **Seller:** "Það hem nýtr fyrir þinn." *(It suits you well.)*
 - **Rúna's voice drops to a mutter.**
 - **Rúna:** "Sakka þik." *(Thank you.)*
 - **Rúna turns and leaves the seller's stand.**
