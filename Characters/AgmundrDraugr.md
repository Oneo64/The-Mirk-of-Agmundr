Agmundr was Hjalvir's father who traveled to Agmundaland. It died after being killed by the natives and was buried in a mound.

## Appearance
Agmundr appears to be withered, with greyed out eyes, and sparse black hair. It stands at about 5'11", which is taller than many people. It has a gnarly wound in its stomach as if someone drove a sharp object though it.

It wears a suit of old maille, worn pants, a belt and a pair of shoes. On its head sits a rusty helmet. Agmundr carries a longseax.

## Personality
Agmundr is extremely playful yet cruel. Like many draugr, it is extremely and violently protective of it's valuables. 

## Abilities
Like many draugr, Agmundr sits at it's burial spot with absolute stillness until one disturbs it's equipment, then it will rise.

### Physicality
Agmundr is skilled with the longseax. It is twice as strong as a normal living man.

### Draugric powers
Because Agmundr is a draugr, it has a few abilities only they can have. It possesses the ability to possess creatures, and killing the creature doesn't kill the draugr. It is also able to turn itself into a billow of mist or disguise itself as a deer, elk, or moose. It can also give dreams and visions to other people.
