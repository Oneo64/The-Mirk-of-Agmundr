Sága is an explorer from Álahringr.

## Appearance
Sága has shoulder-length curly black hair and fair skin. Her eyes are captivatingly green, and her right eye is slightly browner than her left. Her eyebrows are thinner, and her ears are slightly pointed. She is 5'4" tall.

Sága casually wears a dark red tunic, brown pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. She wears a necklace of a strange-looking pebble she found near the river.

When Sága is outside, she wears a dark brown cloak with double brooches. When Sága is training or traveling, she carries her nasal helmet, kite shield, and baldric scabbard.

## Personality
Sága, like her father, is adventurous and curious. Normally, Sága wouldn't strike up conversation as fast and as eagerly as an extrovert would, but once she gets into a conversation, especially small talk, she becomes very talkative.

Sága likes to tell stories, especially heroic sagas (hence her name) that she's read. When asked, her favorite types of sagas are those where the protagonist goes on a journey and experiences the wonders and horrors of the world outside of his home village.

Sometimes, Sága tries to be independent to prove her worth, even if whatever she's going to do would be considered reckless by many.

### Voice
Sága speaks in a poetic way as if she's telling a story.

 - "I have a tale to tell!"
 - "I announce to you all! Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni, the tale of which Jóki, he and Yngvarr..."
 - "Father, he means no harm. I think he is only cursed. Back at our village, I saw him panic at the sight of a guard at eve, like he had seen a ghost."

### Seyja
Sága sees Seyja as a role model and aspires to be as brave as her.

### Ljörn
Sága thinks Ljörn is bewitched.[^1]

### Goals
**Goal:** To explore the new land.
**Motivation:** The thrill of adventure.

### Voice
Sága speaks in a story-like manner. She tries to speak confidently like Seyja, but this act drops when she's alone or with close ones. She tends to use the word *for* as a replacement for *as* or *because*.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Sága sports a sword and shield, but isn't very good at it. She learned a move from her father, which is how to disarm someone with her weaponry.

### Story-telling
Sága can tell stories as she makes them up. She can also tell them without planning any characters or storyline.

### Language
Apart from Old Norse, Sága can speak Proto-Germanic.

### Hypnotism
For some reason, Sága knows how to hypnotize a chicken.
