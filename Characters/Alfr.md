Álfr is a settler from Álahringr who travelled to a northern island as part of Hjalvir's company, and is also the one who persuaded Ljörn to go there with him.

## Appearance
Álfr has fair skin which is slightly tanned, dark blue eyes, brown hair that goes all the way down to his armpits, and a stubble.

He wears a blue woolen cap with green accents, dark blue shawl, a maille hauberk, a dark green tunic, and a pair of brown pants. He has a pouch and a bearded axe on his belt, a 12 inch long seax, and he wears boots on his feet. He wears an iron Talmundúr amulet. He is 5'8" centimeters tall.

He wears a maille-less Gjermundbu helmet in combat. He has a spear, and a white round shield with a black symbol (Helm of Awe) painted on it.

## Personality
Álfr can be described as a competitive and persuasive warrior. He is also impulsive, sometimes not thinking before acting out. He is also mindful of his surroundings, and is careful not to knock anything over or do anything clumsy. However, he can show cowardice to the unknown, to people with much more fighting power, or people with greater political power.

Álfr has a subtle sense of humor, yet his sense of humor only shows during hard times.

### Voice
Álfr speaks casually. He also has the tendancy to blurt words out.

 - "Ljörn, think about it! We could become-"
 - "Hey. Are you still thinking about Álahringr?"
 - "I told you this land would be prosperous. And, they're going to Fjörðvík, father is. The war won't touch them there. You don't need to worry about them."
 - "Yes, it's annoying."
 - "The explorers took three days, I heard."
 - "See them?"
 - "Look at the man's helmet."
 - "I never seen one like it."
 - "Ljörn, what are you-"
 - "Wait. Wait, the wolves."
 - "I want to go there, we can see better."
 - "They look as if they won't wake til noon."
 - "We are two men. And, we didn't sail three days in rain and thunder just to idle in a house!"
 - "Finally, food that isn't fish! Smells fine too, don't you think?"
 - "Yes, but this one's got eggs."
 - "Ljörn, stop that!"
 - "Don't lie. You had the same thing on the boat. I know you were awake, so don't fool me now."
 - "Right. I'll be back."
 - "Ugh... nasty thing. It's gone done me."
