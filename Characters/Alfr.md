Álfr is a settler from Álahringr who travelled to a northern island as part of Hjalvir's company, and is also the one who persuaded Ljörn to go there with him.

## Appearance
Álfr has fair skin, which is slightly tanned, blue eyes, brown hair that extends to his armpits, and stubble.

He wears a blue woollen cap with green accents, a dark blue shawl, a maille hauberk, a dark green tunic, and a pair of brown pants. He has a pouch and a bearded axe on his belt, a 12-inch-long seax, and he wears boots on his feet. He wears an iron Talmundúr amulet. He is 5'8" tall.

He wears a maille-less Gjermundbu helmet in combat. He has a spear and a white, round shield with an Ægishjálmr (Helm of Awe) symbol painted on it.

## Personality
Álfr can be described as a competitive and persuasive warrior. He is also impulsive, sometimes not thinking before acting out. He is also mindful of his surroundings and is careful not to knock anything over or do anything clumsy. However, he can show cowardice to the unknown, to people with much more fighting power, or to people with greater political power.

Álfr has a subtle sense of humour, yet it only shows during hard or stressful times.

Álfr speaks casually and tends to blurt his words out.

### Arc
 - Positive Arc
 - PERSUASIVE -> REGRET -> OPEN-MINDED
 - **Ghost:** Ljörn is too passive.
 - **Lie:** Ljörn needs to be as mature and as lively as me.
 - **Want:** I want Ljörn to not be a coward.
 - **Need:** I need to realise that Ljörn is under pressure.
 - **Truth:** Ljörn wants personal peace.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Álfr has six years' worth of spear-fighting practice, which makes him above average in combat with his spear. He usually likes to fight safely by keeping a distance with his shield in front of him, waiting for an opening to strike. Without his spear, unless the enemy had their weapon pointing at him (if they had one), he would throw himself at them, tackle them to the ground, and try to get a stab with his seax.

### Rægtafl
Álfr knows how to play Rægtafl.

## Goals
 - **Goal:** To explore the new land.
 - **Motivation:** Successfulness and wealthiness.

## Example Dialogue
 - "Ljörn, think about it! We could become-"
 - "Hey. Are you still thinking about Álahringr?"
 - "I told you this land would be prosperous. And, they're going to Fjörðvík, father is. The war won't touch them there. You don't need to worry about them."
 - "Yes, it's annoying."
 - "The explorers took three days, I heard."
 - "See them?"
 - "Look at the man's helmet."
 - "I never seen one like it."
 - "Ljörn, what are you-"
 - "Wait. Wait, the wolves."
 - "I want to go there, we can see better."
 - "They look as if they won't wake til noon."
 - "We are two men. And, we didn't sail three days in rain and thunder just to idle in a house!"
 - "Finally, food that isn't fish! Smells fine too, don't you think?"
 - "Yes, but this one's got eggs."
 - "Ljörn, stop that!"
 - "Don't lie. You had the same thing on the boat. I know you were awake, so don't fool me now."
 - "Right. I'll be back."
 - "Ugh... nasty thing. It's gone done me."
