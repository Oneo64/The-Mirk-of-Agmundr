Alfrir wakes up later after feeling funny in his stomach. The rain is a light shower now. He takes a torch outside to take a stroll and get fresh air. But when he is outside, he spots one of the colonisers looking at the ocean and learns that the second longboat didn't arrive.

Ingólfr, angry, shouts a battle cry and charges at the goat and a fight (colonists vs magical goat) starts.

Meanwhile, the other longboat finally arrives.

The goat is eventually struck dead when Ljörn realises the other boat has arrived, gets his hands on his sword, and slices its face off.

New fruit: Hjalvir arranges an exploring team to explore the nearby forest. Ljörn, Alfrir, Ingólfr, Rúna, and Sága are arranged. Ljörn and Alfrir were chosen because of their experience with supernatural creatures, Ingólfr is to lead, Rúna to identify herbs, and Sága because she's Hjalvir's daughter. They discover crowberries, but don't know what it is.

Ljörn gets his first PTSD attack after seeing a dead troll corpse alone. He makes his escape but gets lost.

The Flower: As Ljörn was lost, he discovers arctic thymes. Cautiously, he smells them, decides he likes them, and pockets them.

Tea: Ljörn finds his way back to the village. Hjalvir scolds him, but Ljörn shows him the arctic thyme. Ljörn is sent away. He then gives the arctic thyme to Rúna so she can study it.
