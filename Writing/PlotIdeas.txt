1, Sea Paranoia: Ljörn sails on the longboat. This is the introductory chapter for Ljörn, Alfrir, and Hjalvir. Ljörn begins to show subtle signs of his PTSD.

Before they get to the land, it starts to pour rain.

---

2, Defenseless in Night: They arrive at the land. They seek shelter in the community hall that Agmundr built to stay for the night. Sága is introduced in this chapter. Sága tells a tale to brighten the mood, the tale is titled Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni.

As Sága announces the story's title, Ljörn upsets and leaves the community hall. He paces outside. Alfrir goes to calm him down.

Later, they are all asleep when Alfrir wakes up, feeling funny in his stomach. The rain is a light shower now. He takes a torch he lit from the hearth outside to take a stroll to get fresh air. But when he is outside, he spots one of the colonisers looking at the ocean and learns that the second longboat didn't arrive.

---

3, Without the Wrought Weapons: Ljörn wakes up and finds that the storm is over. He rises earlier than the other men. He wakes Alfrir, who didn't get a good sleep. Alfrir explains that he felt sick and had to take a stroll. After dagmal, Ljörn asks why they still weren't given their weapons and armor. Alfrir tells him the second boat haven't arrived.

---

4, The Völva: Becoming increasingly paranoid as he looks out into the ocean, Ljörn seeks out the seeress. He finds her by the shore and asks for their woe. She reveals a cryptic message, which really means that magic may come and Ljörn might make an escape.

Later that night, Ljörn's paranoia takes over and he decides sneak out to the shore and escape the island with the longboat. But as he comes near it, he realises that the sail was torn, and there's no way he could push the boat back to sea himself.

A guard spots him and questions him. Ljörn lies that he was missing his tools on the boat. The guard, not believing him, commands him to go back.

---

5, Tree and Lyng, Crowberries' Spring: In the morning, the boat finally arrives. The warriors go and collect their weaponry. When Ljörn and Alfrir retrieves their spears, they exchange looks. Alfrir chuckles in relief.

Hjalvir calls the two and arranges an exploring team to explore the nearby forest. Rúna and Ingólfr are both introduced into the story. Sága meets Ljörn for the first time, and expresses her thoughts about him being cursed. Ljörn ignores her, and Alfrir starts to disdain Sága.

Ljörn, Alfrir, Rúna, and Sága are arranged, under the lead of Ingólfr. Ljörn and Alfrir were chosen because of their experience with supernatural creatures, Rúna to identify herbs, and Sága because she's Hjalvir's daughter.

As they wander in the forest, Rúna asks Ljörn if he really is cursed, and Ljörn denies it. Later, Rúna discovers crowberries. Sága says they're just blueberries, but is ultimately convinced when she tastes a drop of its juices.

---

6, Dark Hill in a Forest of Gloom:
As they continue on, they find the border to a darker forest. In the distance, Ljörn spots a small out-of-place hill. Alfrir is the one that notifies everyone. Sága agrees on going to check it out.

Ingólfr, true to his fearless personality and determination to become a leader, makes his way towards the hill. Ljörn hesitates, watching as everyone follows the leader, but sees that Rúna also hesitated. They exchange glances, and Ljörn, not wanting to be seen as cowardly, follows. Rúna follows last.

As they circle around the hill, Ljörn starts to experience hypervigilance. Alfrir finds a brass ornate goblet on the ground and picks it up. He shares his find. After a while, the group doesn't find anything more, so they return to the settlement.

---

7, The Herbalist: A month passes. The story introduces three houses and three rye farms. Ljörn, feeling stressed and wanting to escape the constant feeling of being followed, decides to seek Rúna out. He asks if she knows about any herb that could calm the mind. She suggests chamomile, but Ljörn had already tried the herb and says that isn't for the mind. She then suggests catnip. Ljörn gets offended easily, saying he's not some stray cat. Ljörn abruptly leaves.

---

8, Blind Eagle's Eye: The second longboat arrives. The warriors are called to retrieve their arsenal. Now properly armed, Hjalvir calls for Ljörn and Alfrir. They are arranged with Ingólfr (the leader), Rúna, and Sága. This time, they are to go atop a small hill to get a better look of the land.

There is a tree on the hill. When Ljörn circles to the other side of the tree, he gets a PTSD attack, seeing a troll corpse alone. He backs away. trips over a rock, and falls to the foot of the hill into the forest. Alfrir is the first to go after him, the other three following behind. They couldn't find him, so they presume him dead.

---

9, Negotiations: Meanwhile, the sun is low, the trees cast long shadows over the farmstead. Sága notices that Alfrir is shaken, only helping others to carry back felled trees and not actually cutting them down. Alfrir gets angry, later regret that he made Ljörn come. After she fails at persuading Alfrir to brighten, she notices a group of people approaching from the forest.

A troll tribe had sent a small group to the farmstead. They say that the company has been trespassing their land and threaten to attack them if they don't leave. Hjalvir manages to make peace with them by trading items, so the people, indivisually, take turns in attempting to make a trade with them. Some are successful, some aren't. But when it is Sága's turn, she offers her seax to the trolls. The trolls freak out as they realise that Sága's seax is made of iron. They take it as an insulting gesture and leave the farmstead.

---

10, The Flower and the Neck: As Ljörn was lost, he finds a river. There he encounters the Nykr. Hearing its voices, he becomes tempted to touch it's fur. But he resists, forcing the Nykr to return to the river. Ljörn chases it with his sword, but the Nykr escapes. Ljörn spots arctic thymes near the river.

Cautiously, he picks the arctic thyme with his seax and smells them, and finds he actually likes the smell. He then remembers how he was reluctant to come to the new land, and realises he might like the land more than he thought. He hesitantly pockets the arctic thyme and leaves before the Nykr comes back.

---

11, Sága's Saga: Sága, regretful of her decision, decides to leave the farmstead to find the trolls and make peace with them again. Instead of finding the trolls, she stumbles back to the suspicious hill she's been before. Instead of looking for the trolls, her curiosity takes over and explores the hill again.

Looking high and low, she discovers an entrace to the hill. There is a hall, a throne, and on the throne sits a withered corpse. The hall is scattered with random pieces of treasures. Sága takes a breath, amazed by her discovery. But instead of taking them, she remembers the nature of draugr and leaves, because she thinks it might be one.

Then, when Sága attempts to return, she finds that she is lost. But luckily, Ljörn finds her. He tells her that he stood on a hill and saw smoke, meaning he knew the way back.

---

12, Talk over Tea: After Ljörn and Sága find their way back, Hjalvir scolds Ljörn in the community hall. Ljörn shows him the arctic thyme, but Hjalvir doesn't care. Sága reveals her findings and tells him that Ljörn was the one to bring her back. Anyhow, Hjalvir sends Ljörn away.

Curiously, Ljörn hides outside the community hall's window and overhears what Sága found. Ljörn takes it as a warning sign, but he tells himself its not a draugr.

---

13, River's Bond: After overhearing Sága's discovery, Ljörn finds Rúna again, who is sitting by the river. He gives her the arctic thyme so she can study it. She says its thyme, but she's never seen one like it before. They talk a little more than they're used to. Ljörn mentions the Nykr and tells her what happened, albeit awkwardly because he's socially awkward. Ljörn realises he's talking more and leaves, embarrassed.

---

14, Hate for the Foreign: Alfrir's daily life is shown, where he falls trees. With Ljörn's help, he carries the log back. As a second tree falls, a raid happens at the farmstead. The trolls have returned, and they attack the settlement.

Unfortuately, Ingólfr and several guards were at the outskirts. They first retreat and sound their war horns. The trolls hesitate, scared by the noise. Their hesitation gives the colonists time to prepare.

During the battle, Hjalvir is hit in the head by a thrown javelin. Luckily, he was wearing his helmet and survives the hit. Sága goes on an angry killing rampage.

They scare them away with superior weaponry.

---

15, Völva's Vision: The seeress claimed that she received a vision of a draugr's tomb on the island. She says that it can control and transform into animals.

After hearing her vision, Ljörn realises that the mound he was hesistant to approach was the tomb of a draugr. He panics, grieving at the thought of the draugr seeking him, Alfrir, Sága, and Rúna out.

---

16, Storm God's Rite: The colonists had finally finished the farms and pens, goats in the fence. Hjalvir decides to celebrate by cremating a goat in the bonfire, along with runesticks of every colonists' name, in honour of the storm god Þórr.

Ljörn eagerly participates. Rúna gives Ljörn and Alfrir a runestick of their names. Ljörn's runestick was carved from a juniper branch, unlike Alfrir's, which was made from beech. Ljörn doesn't think much about it.

---

17, Talking Goat and Bloody Blade: A seemingly intelligent goat visits the village. Ljörn thinks it's tanngrisnir, and tells Alfrir. Alfrir proclaims that it is the goat of Þórr and they start to think they've been blessed.

But after the goat messes with the colonisers, an archer tries to shoot it dead. The arrow is pushed out of the goat's body and lands on the ground. The goat charges at the archer and knocks him out cold.

Angry, Ingólfr shouts a battle cry and charges at the goat and a battle (colonists vs magical goat) begins.

The goat is eventually struck dead when Alfrir sneaks behind the goat and pins it down with his spear, with Ljörn slicing its face off with his sword.

Looking at the body of the goat, Ljörn realises it was one of the colonists goats, and not Tanngrisnir.

---

18, Decisions: It is dusk. Ljörn, true to his low self-esteem, almost falls to depression. He finds the boat repaired and considers again to leave the island. But then, he remembers Alfrir, Rúna, and the arctic thyme which he seemed to like. He turns away from the boat and returns to the farmstead.

---

19, Sight of the Sacred's Spjall: At evening, Ljörn is prepared to return. But this time instead of a guard who finds him, its Rúna.

Rúna asks Ljörn if he was about to leave the land. Ljörn doesn't respond as she already knew. Rúna gets angry, but for a different reason other than betraying the colony.

Before they could say more, Ljörn spots the draugr at the farmstead. The two hide in the tall bushes near the coast and watches it as it makes its way to the goat pen.

It clicks and Ljörn realises it was the draugr who deceived them all.

---

20, The Revenant's Woe: The draugr opens the door to the house Alfrir is at. But with rage, Ljörn comes out of the bush after the draugr. Rúna tries to make Ljörn stay, but he doesn't hear her clearly. Ljörn goes to fight it anyway. But then when he nears it and sees the face of the draugr, he gets another PTSD attack. Ljörn only manages to deflect the draugr's blow and is knocked over, overpowered.

The fight awakens Alfrir and Sága, who both arm themselves. Alfrir, seeing Ljörn overpowered and the draugr turning around to go after him, he begins to doubt himself, showing his cowardice. The draugr demands his goblet back by pointing at it, but when Alfrir refuses and the draugr preparing to strike Alfrir first, Sága makes the conscious decision surprise attack the draugr.

The draugr turns itself into mist and leaves the house. The colonists come out and search for the draugr. But when they lower their guards, the draugr returns with a torch and from inside, sets fire to the house.

Hjalvir sees the draugr as it emerges from the house. Hjalvir is shocked when he sees the burning longhouse and recognises the face of the draugr being Agmundr, his father and the founder of the land.

The draugr goes after Alfrir again. Alfrir stabs the draugr with his spear but it doesn't kill the draugr. The draugr just grips the shaft of his spear and snaps it into two by crushing it in its fist.

But just before the draugr could do anything else, Ljörn overcomes his PTSD, leaps at the draugr and cleaves his sword into the draugr's skull, killing it.
