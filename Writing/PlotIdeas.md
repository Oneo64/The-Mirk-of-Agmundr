---

## 1. Sea Paranoia
Ljörn sails to Agmundaland.

## 2. The Völva
At night, Ljörn goes through a PTSD episode and experiences a flashback of war. He gets anxious so he leaves the hall to seek out the Völva to ask for omens. The völva tells him someone will find a goblet which will awaken something.

## 3. Tree and Lyng
Hjalvir arranges a group, Ljörn, Alfrir, Ingólfr, Rúna, and Sága, to go explore the forest. They discover crowberries. They then discover a suspicious mound, and Alfrir finds a goblet there.

## 4. Goblet
At night, Ljörn and Alfrir are both awaken after having the same dream of the goblet. They suspect something is wrong with it and try to find out why, but fail.

## 5. Negotiations
A troll tribe discovers the farmstead. Sága makes peace by speaking Proto-Norse to them, and they trade. Alfrir gets Ljörn to trade something, but to avoid embarrassment, he trades his cloak (brooch excluded) for an obsidian knife.

Sága tries to trade a metal knife with the trolls, but they think its an insult and leave.

## 6. Blind Eagles Eye
During a trip into the forest, Ljörn undergoes a PTSD episode after seeing a corpse and falls off the hill into the forest. The group can't find him so they think he's dead.

## 7. The Flower and the Neck
Ljörn wakes up (he was out cold) and is lost in the forest. He is chased by a bear. So he climbs a tree and pulls his sword. The bear climbs after him, but he cuts it with his sword. The bear goes away.

Later, he finds a river and is tempted by the Nykr after seeing it. He resists, charges at it with his sword, but when it disappears, he's distracted by arctic thymes (new discovery!) near the river. He picks them, smells them, likes them, and keeps them.

## 8. The Discovery
Later, Ljörn finds a tall rock and climbs it. He sees smoke and follows it back to the farmstead. But when he does, he finds Sága lost too because she tried to find the trolls to reason with them. They both return.

When they return, Hjalvir sends Ljörn away. Sága tells Hjalvir about her discovery, but Ljörn eavesdropped out of curiosity.

Ljörn finds Alfrir to tell him, and Alfrir is surprised he is alive. He thought Ljörn went to Hel, but Ljörn ignores that and tells Alfrir about the draugr mound.

## 9. River's Bond
Ljörn finds Rúna by the river to tell her about the draugr mound, but they end up talking about the Nykr and the arctic thymes.

## 10. Trolls in Winter
Trolls come back to attack. Ljörn sees that so he escorts Rúna back to the farmstead and fights them.

## 11. Storm God's Rite
To celebrate their victory against the trolls, they perform a ritual at night for Þórr and sacrifice one of their domestic goats. Right after it ends, Rúna finds Ljörn and asks him to go to the nearby meadows. There she gives him a new cloak (hands accidentally touch each other, Ljörn feels warmth) and asks him to stay. They return to the farmstead when it starts to get too dark.

## 12. Goat's Bane
A magical goat comes out of the forest to visit the farmstead. They think it's Tanngrisnir, but then it starts to attack them. They kill it, then realise its actually one of their goats.

## 13. Sight of the Sacred's Spjall
The völva claims she had a dream of Alfrir's goblet, and its very similar to Ljörn's dream. Ljörn and Alfrir are convinced the goblet is evil or something, so they try to discard it by throwing it into the river.

Later that night, Ljörn wakes up after hearing a noise. He wakes Rúna first, then Alfrir. He then tells them what he heard. Alfrir wakes Sága. Ljörn looks out the windows and see no wolves or bears. They leave (Ljörn pulls his sword out before leaving) to check what that noise was. They see a silhouette of someone (the draugr) in the distance, near the river, looking for something.

They chase after the draugr, but it flees and disappears into the forest.
