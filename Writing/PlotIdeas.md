# Act 1: Discovery
## 1, Sea Paranoia
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** Ljörn and Alfrir are on the longship

Ljörn sails on the longboat. This is the introductory chapter for Ljörn, Alfrir, and Hjalvir. Ljörn begins to show subtle signs of his PTSD.

Before they get to the land, it starts to pour rain.

They arrive at the land. They seek shelter in the community hall that Agmundr built to stay for the night.

## 2, Defenseless in Night
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** Ljörn sits against he community hall's wall

After a long moment of waiting, Ljörn gets a gut feeling the second longboat didn't arrive with them. The others also have the same feeling. They only have their shields and knives.

Sága is introduced in this chapter. A long moment passes, and Sága decides to brighten the mood by telling a story. As Sága announces the story's title, *Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni*, Ljörn becomes upset at the word "draugr" and leaves the community hall.

Ljörn paces outside. Alfrir goes after him to calm him down and persuade Ljörn to return. Ljörn refuses. Alfrir has no choice but to stay with him outside.

Outside, they meet their first foe: a wild boar. Ljörn doesn't have time to ready his shield when the boar charges at him. He manages to dodge it. The two draw their seaxes, but when Alfrir tackles it and stabs it in the back, the boar rams into him in return. The boar charges Alfrir into the hall, and when Alfrir lands into the hearth, it is extinguished.

After a chaotic struggle, Alfrir pins the boar down and strikes it repeatedly with the boss of its shield until it dies.

Hjalvir finds Alfrir. Ljörn, almost resentful, expects Alfrir to be beaten, But instead, Hjalvir tells Alfrir that he has done well.

The two share a conversation before going to sleep.

## 3, Firewood
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** Ljörn is slumped against the community hall's wall when he awakes

Ljörn wakes up and finds that the storm is over. He rises earlier than the others. He wakes Alfrir, who didn't get a good sleep. Alfrir explains that he felt sick and had to take a stroll.

After dagmal, Hjalvir gathers five groups of two to be sent out to gather sticks for fire. Ljörn thinks about protesting, but stops himself when he realises its no use.

Ingólfr is introduced into the story. Wandering in the forest, Ingólfr and Ljörn gather sticks. Ingólfr makes it clear that Ljörn should carry the firewood, and he himself should collect and fight if needed. Ljörn gets paranoid as he wanders in the forest weaponless.

## 4, The Völva
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** Ljörn sits in the community hall again, but the fire is lower

During the night, Ljörn sits in the half dark. He forces himself to stay, painfully listening as Sága continues the tale. As she comes to describe the draugr, Ljörn is staring at the community hall's door and from it, he experiences a flashback to the moment he had been dreading about.

After his flashback finishes, Ljörn leaves the hall again to seek out the Völva. The Völva is introduced into the story. Ljörn finds her by the shore and asks for his woe. She reveals a cryptic message, which really means that magic may come and Ljörn might make an escape.

That same night, his paranoia takes over and he decides to go to their boat, which is now anchored by a rope tied to a log they stuck in the sand. He plans to escape the island with the longboat. But as he comes near it, he realises that the sail was torn and there's no way he could push the boat back to sea himself.

A guard spots him and questions him. Ljörn lies that he was missing his tools on the boat. The guard, not believing him, commands him to go back.

## 5, Tree and Lyng, Berrybushes' Spring
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** Ljörn and Alfrir are with a throng of warriors who want their weapons and armor

In the morning, the boat finally arrives. The warriors go and collect their weaponry, arming themselves. When Ljörn and Alfrir retrieves their spears, they exchange looks. Alfrir chuckles in relief.

Hjalvir calls the two and arranges an exploring team to explore the nearby forest. Rúna is introduced into the story. Ljörn, Alfrir, Rúna, and Sága are arranged, under the lead of Ingólfr. Ljörn and Alfrir were chosen because of their experience with supernatural creatures, Rúna to identify herbs, and Sága because she's Hjalvir's daughter.

Sága meets Ljörn for the first time, and expresses her thoughts about him being cursed. Ljörn ignores her, and Alfrir starts to disdain Sága.

As they wander in the forest, Rúna asks Ljörn if he really is cursed, and Ljörn denies it.

Later, Rúna discovers crowberries. Sága says they're just blueberries, but is ultimately convinced when she tastes a drop of its juices.

## 6, Dark Hill in a Forest of Gloom
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** The group is in the brighter forest when they see the darker forest

As they continue on, they find the border to a darker forest. In the distance, Ljörn spots a small out-of-place hill. Alfrir is the one that notifies everyone. Sága agrees on going to check it out.

Ingólfr, true to his fearless personality and determination to become a leader, makes his way towards the hill. Ljörn hesitates, watching as everyone follows the leader, but sees that Rúna also hesitated. They exchange glances, and Ljörn, not wanting to be seen as cowardly, follows. Rúna follows last.

As they circle around the hill, Ljörn starts to experience hypervigilance. Alfrir finds a brass ornate goblet on the ground and picks it up. He shares his find. After a while, the group doesn't find anything more, so they return to the settlement.

# Act 2: Bonds and Consequences
## 7, The Herbalist
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** Ljörn is on the farmstead's path

A month has passed, and the story introduces three houses, three rye farms, and one goat pen. Ljörn, feeling stressed and wanting to escape the constant feeling of being followed, decides to seek Rúna out, who is sitting on a stump by the river.

He asks if she knows about any herb that could calm the mind. She suggests chamomile, but Ljörn had already tried the herb and says that isn't for the mind. She then suggests catnip. Ljörn gets offended easily, saying he's not some stray cat. Ljörn abruptly leaves.

## 8, Negotiations
**POV:** Ljörn

**Scene starts:** On the path halfway to the farmstead

The sun is low, meaning long shadows are cast over the farmstead by the forest. Ljörn notices a group of people approaching them from the forest, so he returns to Rúna and alerts her.

A troll tribe had sent a small group to the farmstead. They say that the company has been trespassing their land and threaten to attack them if they don't leave. Hjalvir manages to make peace with them by trading items, so the people, indivisually, take turns in attempting to make a trade with them. Some are successful, some aren't.

When Alfrir persuades Ljörn to make a trade, Ljörn realises he doesn't have a lot to trade, but it is too late. Ljörn, not wanting to be embarrassed, trades his cloak (he keeps the brooch). The trolls give him an obsidian knife. Alfrir congratulates him.

But when it is Sága's turn, she offers her seax to the trolls. The trolls freak out as they realise that Sága's seax is made of iron. They take it as an insulting gesture and leave the farmstead.

## 9, Blind Eagle's Eye
**POV:** Ljörn

Hjalvir calls for an exploration team again. Alfrir gets Ljörn to go. The two are arranged with Ingólfr (the leader), Rúna, and Sága. This time, they are to go atop a small hill to get a better look of the land.

There is a tree on the hill. When Ljörn circles to the other side of the tree, he gets a PTSD attack, seeing a troll corpse alone. He backs away. trips over a rock, and falls to the foot of the hill into the forest. Alfrir is the first to go after him, the other three following behind. They couldn't find him, so they presume him dead.

## 10, Warrior's Wane
**POV:** Ljörn

Alfrir is shaken by Ljörn's presumed death. He watches over a new farm being tilled by farmers, still down. Sága finds him and asks him what troubles him. Alfrir shows his regret when he made Ljörn join the colony and that he killed him with his persuasion. He is even more upset that Ljörn won't be going to Valhöll, and instead, Hel.

Sága tells Alfrir that they can go and look for him, but Alfrir is already convinced.

## 11, The Flower and the Neck
**POV:** Ljörn

Ljörn wakes up after out cold for a while. He gets lost and finds a river. There he encounters the Nykr. Hearing its voices, he becomes tempted to touch it's fur. But he resists, forcing the Nykr to return to the river. Ljörn chases it with his sword, but the Nykr escapes. Ljörn spots arctic thymes near the river.

Cautiously, he picks the arctic thyme with his seax and smells them, and finds he actually likes the smell. He then remembers how he was reluctant to come to the new land, and realises he might like the land more than he thought. He hesitantly pockets the arctic thyme and leaves before the Nykr comes back.

## 12, The Discovery
**POV:** Ljörn

Wandering around the forest, he eventually finds a hill. He climbs it and sees the smoke of the hall. He gains hope and follows it.

Ljörn finds himself back in the darker forest again. There he encounters Sága, who tells him she was lost too. Ljörn leads the way back to the farmstead.

After Ljörn and Sága find their way back, Hjalvir scolds Ljörn in the community hall. Ljörn shows him the arctic thyme, but Hjalvir doesn't care. Sága reveals her findings and tells him that Ljörn was the one to bring her back. Anyhow, Hjalvir sends Ljörn away.

Curiously, Ljörn hides outside the community hall's window and overhears their conversation. Sága reveals that she wanted to make peace with the troll tribe again. After Hjalvir tells her not to do it again, she tells him that she found out the suspicious hill they found was a burial site, and there was a corpse sitting on a throne with jewellery scattered around the tomb's only room. When she says it might be a draugr, Ljörn leaves to find Alfrir.

When the two meet again, Alfrir exclaims in fear, thinking he is seeing Ljörn's ghost. Ljörn quickly defuses his surprise. Alfrir says he thought he had gone to Hel, and Ljörn brushes it off.

Ljörn tells Alfrir about the draugr. Alfrir doesn't apologise, but he doesn't persuade or even bring up the idea of going to find the draugr's tomb together to kill it. Alfrir says he'll tell the others, and he leaves Ljörn. Ljörn decides to go find Rúna.

## 13, River's Bond
**POV:** Ljörn

Ljörn finds Rúna again, who is sitting by the river. Rúna is surprised that Ljörn is stil alive. Ljörn apologises for his earlier anger.

When Rúna asks him how he lived, he tells her about his encounter with the Nykr and the hill.

Ljörn askss if she's discovered anything with crowberries, and she says that they're useful for medicine. He then gives her the arctic thyme he found, saying that she may be interested in it. Seeing it, she becomes interested and says that it is thyme, but she has never seen anything like it.

Ljörn later tells her about Sága's discovery.

# Act 3: Wars and Mythology
## 14, Trolls In Winter
**POV:** Ljörn

Snow starts to fall, telling that another month has passed. The farmstead is now covered in a thin layer of snow and there are less needles on the trees. Alfrir's daily life is shown, where he falls trees. With Ljörn's help, he carries the log back. As a second tree falls, a raid happens at the farmstead. The trolls have returned, and they attack the settlement.

Unfortuately for the trolls, Ingólfr and several guards were at the outskirts. They first retreat and sound their war horns. The trolls hesitate, scared by the noise. Their hesitation gives the colonists time to prepare.

During the battle, Ljörn doesn't actually actively fight. Instead, he checks the homes for the safety of those who can't fight. When he opens the last door, he finds Rúna who has a short spear. Ljörn hides his surprise and quickly leaves.

Ljörn regroups with Alfrir, and finds that Alfrir and Sága have somehow came to good terms despite their initial dislike. The three defend the farmstead.

As they fight, Hjalvir is hit in the head by a thrown javelin. Luckily, he was wearing his helmet and survives the hit. Sága, angry at them attacking her father, kills the nearest troll. She then takes her father into a house for shelter, leaving the two to fight on their own.

The colonists eventually scare them away with superior weaponry.

## 15, Storm God's Rite
**POV:** Ljörn

It is evening, and Hjalvir decides to celebrate their victory against the trolls by cremating one of their goats in a bonfire, along with runesticks of every colonists' name, in honour of the storm god Þórr.

Ljörn eagerly participates. Before it begins, Rúna gives Ljörn and Alfrir a runestick of their names. Ljörn's runestick was carved from a juniper branch, unlike Alfrir's, which was made from beech like everyone else's. Ljörn notices but isn't brave enough to confront Rúna about it.

Later, Rúna finds Ljörn, knowing that he is cold. She tells him she wants to show him something. When Ljörn follows her to the nearby meadow, away from the farmstead, she reveals to him a cloak. She insists him wear it anyway because it's cold. The two stay in the meadow for a while, and they only return to the farmstead when the darkness starts to become a problem.

# Act 4: Ending
## 16, Talking Goat and Bloody Blade
**POV:** Ljörn

A seemingly intelligent goat visits the village. Ljörn thinks it's tanngrisnir, and tells Alfrir. Alfrir then proclaims to the colonists that it is the goat of Þórr, and they start to believe they've been blessed.

But after the goat messes with the colonisers, an archer tries to shoot it dead. The arrow is pushed out of the goat's body and lands on the ground. The goat charges at the archer and knocks him out cold.

Angry, Ingólfr shouts a battle cry and charges at the goat and a battle (colonists vs magical goat) begins.

The goat is eventually struck dead when Alfrir sneaks behind the goat and pins it down with his spear, with Ljörn slicing its face off with his sword.

Looking at the body of the goat, Ljörn realises it was one of the colonists goats, and not Tanngrisnir.

## 17, Völva's Vision
**POV:** Ljörn

The seeress claimed that she received a vision of a draugr's tomb on the island. She says that it can control and transform into animals.

After hearing her vision, Ljörn realises that Sága was right, and that the hill he saw was the tomb of a draugr. He panics, grieving at the thought of the draugr seeking him, Alfrir, Sága, and Rúna out.

## 18, Sight of the Sacred's Spjall
**POV:** Ljörn

It is dusk. Ljörn, true to his low self-esteem, almost falls to depression. He finds the boat repaired and considers again to leave the island. But then, he remembers that Rúna wants to stay. Then he remembers Alfrir, who wants to stay too, and the arctic thyme which he seemed to like. He turns away from the boat and leaves.

Before Ljörn could return to the farmstead, someone finds him again. This time, its not a guard who finds him, but its Rúna. Rúna asks Ljörn if he was about to leave the land. Ljörn doesn't respond as she already knew. Rúna gets angry, but it seemed to be for a different, more personal reason than betraying the colony.

Before they could say more, Ljörn spots the draugr at the farmstead. The two hide in the tall bushes near the coast and watches it as it makes its way to the goat pen.

It clicks and Ljörn realises it was the draugr who deceived them all.

## 19, The Revenant's Woe
**POV:** Ljörn

The draugr opens the door to the house Alfrir is at. But with rage, Ljörn comes out of the bush after the draugr. Rúna tries to make Ljörn stay, but he doesn't hear her clearly. Ljörn goes to fight it anyway. But then when he nears it and sees the face of the draugr, he gets another PTSD attack. Ljörn only manages to deflect the draugr's blow and is knocked over, overpowered.

The fight awakens Alfrir and Sága, who both arm themselves. Alfrir, seeing Ljörn overpowered and the draugr turning around to go after him, he begins to doubt himself, showing his cowardice. The draugr demands his goblet back by pointing at it, but when Alfrir refuses and the draugr preparing to strike Alfrir first, Sága makes the conscious decision surprise attack the draugr.

The draugr turns itself into mist and leaves the house. The colonists come out and search for the draugr.

## 20, Agmundr
**POV:** Ljörn

But when they lower their guards, the draugr returns with a torch. It appears in the house Alfrir was in, and it sets the house on fire from the inside.

Hjalvir sees the draugr as it emerges from the house, holding the ornate goblet. Hjalvir is shocked when he sees the burning longhouse and recognises the face of the draugr being Agmundr, his father and the founder of the land.

The draugr goes after Alfrir again, but Ljörn distracts it by stabbing the draugr with his spear.

Ljörn freezes up as he sees the face of the draugr. It grips the shaft of his spear and snaps it into two by crushing it in its fist.

But then, Rúna comes up behind the draugr and hits its neck with her spear, but doesn't decapitate it. The draugr faces Rúna. Seeing Rúna in danger, Ljörn overcomes his PTSD and cleaves his sword into the back of the draugr's skull, ultimately killing it.

## 21, Ashes from the Corpse
**POV:** Ljörn

Hjalvir, still rattled at the fate of Agmundr, makes a hard decision. At the deathplace of Agmundr's revenant, he orders his men to burn Agmundr's body to ensure it never rises again.

then turns to Ljörn and tells him he will be knighted.

When Alfrir and Sága come to Ljörn, asking if he wanted to go to the draugr's tomb to take its valuables, Ljörn accepts.
