# Chapter 1: Nine Hundred and Twenty Two
<!-- SCENARIO 1: Story introduction !-->
Two longboats had their full sails flapping, carried north by the gale. The sun was low. Not a single sea bird flew in the sky, not even the sound of their call. On one of the ships, they had animals. And amongst the crew, a blond-haired man sat on his box.

This blond man was wistfully staring at his amulet. It was a Mjöllnir. His fingers trembled slightly as he held the cold symbol, hoping it would protect him. He stared at it for a moment, then tucked it back into his cloak.

The flapping sail bore a red colour with a blue cross, and a rough texture from the thick flax fibres. A wolf’s skull hung from the bow’s tip, swaying and knocking on the wood.

The blond man looked up into the sky. There was no use smelling the air for an oceany scent; it was everywhere. But by the mirk of the clouds, it was going to rain. He glanced at the stern, where a plank rested against the cargo. A black circular symbol drawn on its surface; it shimmered red in the shade. He knew that was the symbol of a Vegvísir. He heard that such a symbol wouldn’t let any tempest deter them, even if the waves were mad.

The blond man turned his gaze towards the thing they were sailing towards. It was a stripe of a dark colour, but he knew what it was: land.

"Hey. Are you still thinking about Álahringr?" a low voice said behind him.

The blond man looked around to see his brother leaning towards him, his voice drained by the wind. He could tell his brother was amused.

He was reminded of the time two days ago, when his brother persuaded him. Persuaded to join Hjalvir's colonising company. He was reminded of the time he promised himself never to embark upon another journey again. But the thought of peace compelled him, and so here he was.

He remembered when Sága, the explorer's daughter, showed up at their doorstep to advertise the expedition. He remembered walking on the streets of Álahringr, overhearing her promoting him to her father, since she thought he would be a useful mentor, like a guidebook for the supernatural. He wasn't a good teacher.

The blond man didn't respond for a moment. "Alfrir," he sighed, his voice low. "I-"

"I told you this land would be prosperous," said his brother, unintentionally cutting off the words of the blond man. "And, they're going to Fjörðvík, father is. The war won't touch them there. You don't need to worry about them."

The blond man let out a breath. He turned away. He could still feel that irritating sensation of dampness in his socks. He could still taste the basic flavour of fish in his mouth. "Are your boots... wet, too?"

"Yes," his brother answered. "It's annoying."

"How long will this travelling last?" the blond man complained.

"The explorers took three days," his brother answered. "I heard."

Hearing this was the last day he would spend at sea, the blond man allowed a weak smile on his face. He returned his gaze to the ocean. He glanced at his own visage, wavering on the water's surface. He was long-haired, coloured more like old wheat than golden blond. But despite his drowsiness, the manner his pale blue eyes were shaped, a dry, droopy leaf, made it seem as if he hadn't had a good night's sleep in days.

The blond man glanced at the other longship. His weapons, spear and sword, were stored on that ship, kept somewhere within its cargo boxes. He felt… helpless without the feeling of the scabbard belt hugging his shoulders. His hand slowly found his seax and felt the leather of its sheath.

As he gazed into the water, he saw a shadow move. His heart quickened, but he couldn't take his mind away. A gnarly, deathly face rose from the water. It was dead for at least a hundred years, its skin withered and wrinkled like a rotten grape. It lifted a blade, preparing to smite him down, like an executioner with him on a chopping block large enough for his stomach rather than his neck.

"Ljörn!"

The blond man jumped, coming back to his senses at his brother's call. "What?" the blond man sharply asked, breath still ragged. He was confused. For a moment, he was sure he had been found. And then he was back on the boat, his seeker gone!

"You're doing it again," his brother said.

<!-- SCENARIO 2: The wind weakens and Hjalvir's introduction !-->

"The wind falters!" a voice remarked loudly, clear even in the wind. Both the blond man and his brother turned to face whoever had exclaimed.

It was Hjalvir, the man who stood on the bow. He accompanied a shorter woman with a similar face, no doubt his daughter. Hjalvir's short black hair was trimmed nicely for the practicality of his fighting art. His beard ensured no one would mistake him for some boy, and even his eyes weren't as innocent. He had a withering gaze that could bore into the souls of anyone. He turned to oversee everyone on the ship: the men who sat on their seats, and the women who watched over the animals and crates.

"Right, all of you! Get yourself an oar and prepare rowing," he ordered. He looked into the sky, noting where the sun sat. He lowered his gaze back down at the horizon and pointed there. "Northwest," he added.

The rowers stood from their seats to gather their oars. The blond man did the same. He sat back down and lowered the head of the oar into the water.

<!-- SCENARIO 3: The wind is strong again !-->

One hour passed, and the clouds darkened. The winds started to pick up again. "Sails down!" Hjalvir ordered, glancing over his shoulder.

As Ljörn rested his hands and shoulders, he looked at the horizon for the land his brother was hyped about. It appeared as a thick, dark line across the curves of Myrkjörðr. But before he could get a better look, a haze gathered and blurred the land into the ocean.

Hjalvir called one of his men over. They talked in quiet voices. His assistant left the bow to the stern and opened it: dried, salted fish. He distributed the fish amongst the crew. The first were given to Hjalvir, his daughter, the women, then the rowers.

Ljörn was handed a piece of fish. He turned to Alfrir, who was also given some by the man.

"Cheers," Alfrir half-jokingly said, making a small raising gesture with his fish. Ljörn mirrored his gesture. They silently ate.

As Ljörn finished his fish, he felt the first drops of rain. He caressed his slightly hooked nose, wiping the droplets off. "Mmmh," he grumbled.

<!-- SCENARIO 4: It starts to rain !-->

It began to rain. Every time a raindrop hit the boat near the Vegvísir, it seemed to dry almost instantly.

Soon, the rain was pouring, water slowly flooding the ship. The crew members kept the boat from sinking, occasionally scooping up water with buckets and dumping it into the ocean. The waves were bigger now, but the Vegvísir seemed to keep them from sinking the ship.

The ship was hit by a wave, sending a splash of foam and water over the sailors. Hjalvir stumbled, but he wasn't one to fall. He looked to his daughter, who had to hold the side of the longboat to steady herself. He cast a glance at their cargo. Luckily, they were secured by ropes. "Come to the back," he gruffly said to his daughter.

Ljörn hugged his cloak like many others. He watched Hjalvir and his daughter make their ways to the stern. His wavy hair became straight by the wet, dripping at the ends. At least he was warm, thanks to his woollen garbs.

A pool of water gathered where Ljörn didn't notice, but he felt it flood his boots. At least his foot didn't feel like it was swollen anymore. He considered keeping his foot in there, but knew he probably shouldn't. Hesitantly, he took his foot out and took the water in with his bucket, then poured it out of the boat.

He glanced at the ocean. Then, he saw the shadow again. Before he could see more, the rain got into his eyes. He blinked, broke eye contact, and turned back to his brother. "I... I... look!" he hurriedly said.

Alfrir was confused at what Ljörn saw. When Ljörn turned his gaze back to the sea, he saw that the shadow was gone. He let out a breath he had been holding.

Another wave crashed into the ship. The splash splattered all over the cargo. The magic of the symbol did its best to dry out the wood of the crates, but still, water seeped through the inbetweens of their boards.

<!-- SCENARIO 5: The boat arrives !-->

The haze was still in the air when the rain loosened. The wind drove the ship nearer to the coast. The sun, now a cosy colour, touched the horizon’s glow. Ljörn watched Hjalvir as he went to the bow, squinting at the northern land.

It was dark, but Ljörn could make out some things about the land. They were sailing into a small rocky bay, and the land itself was very hilly. There was a dark silhouette on the grassland, probably just a boulder. Behind it laid a forest, tall trees swaying in the rain.

Hjalvir shouted a bracing warning. Ljörn gripped the side of the ship and braced himself, but was surprised when the ship only bumped upwards by the slight slope of the shore.

Ljörn turned around to see the land again. It was only then that he noticed the dark silhouette wasn’t a rock at all. It was a lonely hall with a tarf roof, blending amongst nature’s green. From the lack of light, Ljörn could tell that the hearthfire was out. It was at least twice the length of a longhouse, yet not enough for all of Hjalvir’s company, although it would do for the crew. A small wooden extension was built on the roof, which was almost certainly the chimney.

Hjalvir was the first to set foot upon the wet sand, his boots sinking into the beach water as it soiled and washed them with every wave. Ljörn watched the would-be chieftain stumble forward, chuckling at the sight of such a wild land. "Agmundaland!" he proclaimed. "I, have come!"
