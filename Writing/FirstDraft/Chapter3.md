# Chapter 3: Tree and Lyng
Ljörn was forced awake when the morning light shone on his eyes. The first thing he smelled was leaf and sea. He sat up, slightly slouching. His hand felt his seax, making sure he still had it. He looked to his side and saw Alfrir still asleep.

"Alfrir," he said, shaking his brother awake.

Alfrir came to his senses. Without a word, he sat up.

Ljörn stood and went to check the windows again. Of course, there weren't wolves. It was last night when he heard wolves surrounding the community hall, who then left after they couldn't get inside. He relaxed a bit. Grabbing his shield, he slung it over his shoulder and prepared to leave the longhouse.

"Wait," Alfrir said. "Wait, the wolves."

"They are gone," Ljörn said, watching Alfrir get up too. He turned back to the door and pushed it ajar. Peering outside, he couldn't see or find any animals.

"Are you sure?" Alfrir asked.

"Yes," Ljörn said.

Alfrir looked outside the small crack between the doors. "Can't be too safe," he murmured.

Ljörn unsheathed his seax and slowly pushed the door open. The two stepped back and prepared themselves.

The coast was clear. With the rainy haze gone, the land looked clearer than ever. Downhill, there was a widening river that went into the sea. Beyond the river, the grass sloped up again to a jaggier land, with rocks protruding out of the earth.

"I want to go there," Alfrir said, obviously talking about the other side of the river. "We can see better."

"What? No," Ljörn said, refusing his brother's idea. He just wanted to walk around the longhouse to take a look at it, not go beyond the river to a place where they're vulnerable! "I think we should wait," he said.

"Wait for what?" Alfrir said, looking back at the other colonists who were still sleeping. "They look as if they won't wake til noon."

Ljörn hesitated. His brother was right, they haven't had a good sleep for several days. But apparently, Alfrir wasn't tired. Ljörn didn't want to leave until the others were awake; he was still anxious about several things.

"We are two men," Alfrir said. "And, we didn't sail three days in rain and thunder just to not explore the land!"

Ljörn was starting to regret waking Alfrir. Yet, he was already on the new land, and that meant there wasn't any use to sit around doing nothing. "Fine," he mumbled.

Alfrir turned back and went back to his sleeping spot and gathered his shield. Like his brother, he slung it over his shoulder and walked out of the longhouse.

Ljörn followed Alfrir as they stepped into the grass and made their ways towards the river. There wasn't a path, but that didn't bother Ljörn; he used to take walks in Álahringr's neighbouring forest. The brothers stopped at the bank, and Ljörn looked into the water. The river was waist-deep. He bent down and stuck a finger into the water, feeling that it was freezing cold.

"We could try the log," Alfrir suggested.

Ljörn looked to his side and saw the dry log lying across the river, old and too dangerous to balance on. "No," he said. "It's not good."

They looked for a way across the river and eventually found one: a rock in the middle of the river.

Alfrir went first. He hopped onto the rock and onto the other side.

Ljörn followed after. The rock was slippery; he thought he would slide off, and so he impulsively jumped to the other side.

"Ack!" However, as he landed, he slipped on the grass and hit the ground anyway. He began to roll straight for the river. Panicking, he grabbed a handful of grass and stopped himself just before he plummeted into the icy water.

Ljörn got to his feet, using a nearby rock to balance himself. He looked around for Alfrir, but he wasn't there. "Alfrir? Where are you?"

"I'm on the hill!"

Ljörn climbed the slope and reached the top of the mound. There he saw Alfrir gazing out at the far ends of the beach.

And when Ljörn looked at the landscape of Agmundaland, it was quite a pretty sight. In the distance, there was a cliff with the forest stretching to the top of it. The forest, tall firs and spruces, loomed to their right side. He took a deep breath, taking in the new air. It didn't smell like wood or sea anymore, and he relieved the scent of land again.
