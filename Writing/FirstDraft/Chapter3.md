# Chapter 3: Tree and Lyng
Ljörn was forced awake when the morning light shone on his eyes. The first thing he smelled was leaf and sea. He sat up, slightly slouching. His hand felt his seax, making sure he still had it. He looked to his side and saw Alfrir still asleep.

"Alfrir," he said, shaking his brother awake.

Alfrir came to his senses. Without a word, he sat up.

Ljörn stood and went to check the windows again. Of course, there weren't wolves. It was last night when he heard wolves surrounding the community hall, who then left after they couldn't get inside. He relaxed a bit. Grabbing his shield, he slung it over his shoulder and prepared to leave the longhouse.

"Wait," Alfrir said. "Wait, the wolves."

"They are gone," Ljörn said, watching Alfrir get up too. He turned back to the door and pushed it ajar. Peering outside, he couldn't see or find any animals.

"Are you sure?" Alfrir asked.

"Yes," Ljörn said.

Alfrir looked outside the small crack between the doors. "Can't be too safe," he murmured.

Ljörn pulled his sword out and slowly pushed the door open. The two stepped back and prepared themselves.

The coast was clear. With the rainy haze gone, the land looked clearer than ever. Downhill, there was a widening river that went into the sea. Beyond the river, the grass sloped up again to a jaggier land, with rocks protruding out of the earth.

Relieved, Ljörn sheathed his sword.

"I want to go there," Alfrir said, obviously talking about the other side of the river. "We can see better."

"What? No," Ljörn said, refusing his brother's idea. He just wanted to walk around the longhouse to take a look at it, not go beyond the river to a place where they're vulnerable! "I think we should wait," he said.

"Wait for what?" Alfrir said, looking back at the other colonists who were still sleeping. "They look as if they won't wake til noon."

Ljörn hesitated. His brother was right, they haven't had a good sleep for several days. But apparently, Alfrir wasn't tired. Ljörn didn't want to leave until the others were awake; he was still anxious about several things.

"We are two men," Alfrir said. "And, we didn't sail three days in rain and thunder just to not explore the land!"

Ljörn was starting to regret waking Alfrir. Yet, he was already on the new land, and that meant there wasn't any use to sit around doing nothing. "Fine," he mumbled.

Alfrir turned back and went back to his sleeping spot and gathered his shield. Like his brother, he slung it over his shoulder and walked out of the longhouse.

Ljörn followed Alfrir as they stepped into the grass and made their ways towards the river. There wasn't a path, but that didn't bother Ljörn; he used to take walks in Álahringr's neighbouring forest. The brothers stopped at the bank, and Ljörn looked into the water. The river was waist-deep. He bent down and stuck a finger into the water, feeling that it was freezing cold.

"We could try the log," Alfrir suggested.

Ljörn looked to his side and saw the dry log lying across the river, old and too dangerous to balance on. "No," he said. "It's not good."

They looked for a way across the river and eventually found one: a rock in the middle of the river.

Alfrir went first. He hopped onto the rock and onto the other side.

Ljörn followed after. The rock was slippery; he thought he would slide off, and so he impulsively jumped to the other side.

"Ack!" However, as he landed, he slipped on the grass and hit the ground anyway. He began to roll straight for the river. Panicking, he grabbed a handful of grass and stopped himself just before he plummeted into the icy water.

Ljörn got to his feet, using a nearby rock to balance himself. He looked around for Alfrir, but he wasn't there. "Alfrir? Where are you?"

"I'm on the hill!"

Ljörn climbed the slope and reached the top of the mound. There he saw Alfrir gazing out at the far ends of the beach.

And when Ljörn looked at the landscape of Agmundaland, it was quite a pretty sight. In the distance, there was a cliff with the forest stretching to the top of it. The forest, tall firs and spruces, loomed to their right side. He took a deep breath, taking in the new air. It didn't smell like wood or sea anymore, and he relieved the scent of land again.

After dagmal, Alfrir and Ljörn began felling trees. The forest was right beside them, yet they lingered at the edge. Ljörn swung his axe, chipping away the tree log. They went on for a while until they heard a creak within the stump.

"It's... It's falling!" Ljörn called out, warning anyone nearby to watch out. He hit it again, and the tree wobbled. It then bent, and with a rustling crash, fell to the ground. They surrounded the tree's crown, cleaving off the branches and tossing them to the side. Once the tree was bare, both of them, and two other men, all lifted the trunk and carried it back to the farmstead.

Before their journey, Ljörn was a woodcutter and a farmer. Splitting firewood and pulling weeds were his work; occasionally, he would help Alfrir fell trees and carry them back home. But after they took the fallen tree back to the farmstead, he could call himself an explorer, because a messenger came.

"Dan, the leader wills you," said the messenger. "And him," he added, gesturing to Alfrir.

Dan was a common honourific, and yet, Ljörn had never been addressed like that. He glanced at his brother, then back at the messenger. "Hjalvir?" he asked. "Where is he?"

"He's in the hall," the messenger said. "He's gathering a group to go into the forest."

At the messenger's words, Ljörn got the feeling it wouldn't end well. Even though he'd take peaceful walks in the forest, he always avoided getting near the deeper, darker parts of the forest; he was afraid of them. And looking into the forest nearby, it looked a little darker than the ones he was used to.

Alfrir watched as the summoning took place. "I need to attend too?" he asked, anticipating it.

The messenger nodded. "Yes, you do too," he said. "Um... There's another one I must tell, so good luck."

Hurriedly, the messenger left them there. Ljörn hesitated at the thought of going, but remembered it was by Hjalvir's request.

"Let's go," Alfrir said.

Pushing through the doors of the hall, they found Hjalvir, Sága, and someone else standing closely in a corner. They made their way to them and gathered there. "If you find anything strange, don't mess with it. Something might—"

They stopped talking as they noticed Ljörn and Alfrir join them.

"You're here now," Hjalvir said. "We're now waiting for another, she should be here in a minute."

Ljörn said nothing, but nodded to show his understanding.

Sága was standing there, almost proudly as she held her helmet. She looked eager, like Alfrir, to fare into the forest for the undiscovered.

When Ljörn turned his gaze to the other man, he was one whom Ljörn had never seen nor met. This man, whom he saw, was boldly dressed in a bear-hide cloak, displaying his ferocity. His hair was long and dark, like Alfrir’s. Perhaps it was the way he held himself, but Ljörn didn’t like him.

"Dan, why did you summon me?" Ljörn asked, turning back to Hjalvir. "I'm only a farmer."

"Farmer? Hah!" Hjalvir said with a laugh. "Have you not come with weapons and armour? I have heard about your adventure to that ruin. You'll be a good guide for the group, and your brother too." Hjalvir turned to the bear-cloaked man, and continued, "You will lead the group."

Ljörn bowed his head, understanding his place in the group. He was still hesitant, but decided to go along with them. He wouldn't dare defy Hjalvir. "I'll go and don my armour," he said.

Leaving them temporarily, Ljörn found his kist. His byrnie was lying in a pile like loose rings. His helmet was there too, a conical shape with a guard for his nose. He started by doffing his baldric. Then he wore his byrnie, tying a second belt to secure it to his waist. He picked his cloak up and wrapped it around himself, securing it with a circular brooch. After he was done with that, he donned his baldric over his byrnie, and finally, fitted his helmet atop his head.

He had to admit, wearing his armour again made him feel safe. He shifted a bit, making sure he was comfortable in the ring shirt before joining the rest of the party.

Once back, he glanced at Alfrir, who still hadn't gotten into his armour. "Go don yours," he muttered.

"Right. I'll be back," Alfrir said, and left them to wear his armour. His set was similar to Ljörn’s, except for a few things that were different: he had a hauberk instead of a byrnie, his helmet had eye rings, like a spangenhelm, and he didn't have a sword. Such a helmet like that would make a warrior look terrifying. But when Alfrir wore it, his boyish eyes made being afraid of him confusing.

When they all gathered, Ljörn, Alfrir, Sága, and the bear-cloaked man, that was when the doors opened. A woman came in. She closed the door, careful not to make a bang. She walked towards them, her stride telling Ljörn she wasn’t very flamboyant at all. She wore a dress; however, it only reached the middle of her foot and knee. She had wavy brown hair and a light splatter of freckles across her face. Notably, she kept a distance from everyone else, yet enough to say she was with the party.

"Ah, the herbalist," Hjalvir said, greeting the newcomer. "I assume you know what you'll be?"

The woman glanced at Hjalvir. "Y-yes," she said.

With that, Hjalvir continued what he was saying earlier. "Now that everyone has gathered, remember. If you find anything strange, don't mess with it. We have no power over what... over what witchcraft may happen."

"You are not coming?" Sága asked.

"No," Hjalvir said. "I need to stay behind and oversee the farmers. You can go now."
