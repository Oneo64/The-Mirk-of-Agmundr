# Chapter 3: The Völva
<!-- TEST !-->
Ljörn was forced awake when the morning light shone on his eyes. The first thing he smelled was leaf and sea. He sat up, slightly slouching. His hand felt his seax, making sure he still had it. He looked to his side and saw Alfrir still asleep.

"Alfrir," he said, shaking his brother awake.

Alfrir came to his senses. Without a word, he sat up.

Ljörn stood and went to check the windows again. Of course, the wolves weren't there. He relaxed a bit. Grabbing his shield, he slung it over his shoulder and prepared to leave the longhouse.

"Wait," Alfrir said. "Wait, the wolves."

"They are gone," Ljörn said, watching Alfrir get up too. He turned back to the door and pushed it ajar. Peering outside, he couldn't see nor find any animals.

"Are you sure?" Alfrir asked.

"Yes," Ljörn said.

Alfrir looked outside the small crack between the doors. "Can't be too safe," he murmured.

Ljörn agreed with him. He unsheathed his seax and slowly pushed the door open. The two stepped back and prepared themselves.

The coast was clear. The land could be clearly seen now. Downhill, there was a widening river that went into the sea. Beyond the river, the grass sloped up again to a jaggier land, with rocks protruding out the earth.

"I want to go there," Alfrir said, obviously talking about the other side of the river. "We can see better."

"What? No," Ljörn said, refusing his brother's idea. He just wanted to walk around the longhouse to take a look at it, not go beyond the river to a place where they're vulnerable! "I think we should wait," he said.

"Wait for what?" Alfrir said, looking back at the other colonists who were still sleeping. "They look as if they won't wake til noon."

Ljörn hesitated. His brother was right, they haven't had good sleep for several days. But apparently, Alfrir wasn't tired. Ljörn didn't want to leave until the others were awake; he was still anxious about several things.

"We are two men," Alfrir said. "And, we didn't sail three days in rain and thunder just to not explore the land!"

Ljörn was starting to regret waking Alfrir. Yet, he was on the new, discovered land now. And that meant there wasn't any use to sit around and do nothing. "Fine," he mumbled.

Alfrir turned back and went back to his sleeping spot and gathered his shield. He slung it over his shoulder like his brother, and walked out of the longhouse.

Ljörn followed Alfrir as they stepped into the grass and made their ways towards the river. There wasn't a path, but that didn't bother Ljörn; he used to take walks in Álahringr's neighboring forest. The brothers stopped at the bank, and Ljörn looked into the water. The river was waist-deep. He bent down and stuck a finger into the water, and felt that it was freezing cold.

"We could try the log," Alfrir suggested.

Ljörn looked to his side and saw the dry log lying across the river, old and too dangerous to balance on it. "No," he said. "It's not good."

They looked for a way across the river and eventually found one: a rock in the middle of the river.

Alfrir went first. He hopped onto the rock and onto the other side.

Ljörn followed after. The rock was slippery; he thought he would slide off, and so he impulsively jumped to the other side.

"Ack!" However, as he landed, he slipped on the grass and hit the ground anyway. He began to roll straight for the river. Panicking, he grabbed a handful of grass and stopped himself just before he plummeted into the icy water.

Ljörn got to his feet, using a nearby rock to balance himself. He looekd around for Alfrir, but he wasn't there. "Alfrir? Where are you?"

"I'm on the hill!"

Ljörn climbed the slope and reached the top of the mound. There he saw Alfrir gazing out at the far ends of the beach.

And when Ljörn looked at the landscape of Agmundaland, it was quite a pretty sight. In the distance, there was a cliff, the forest extending to the top of it. The forest, tall firs and spruces, loomed to their right side. He took a deep breath, taking in the new air. It didn't smell like wood or sea anymore, and he relieved the scent of land again.

Now, it is evening. Ingólfr had a driftwood branch for a quarterstaff, taken for his defence. Ljörn's arms were full of dry sticks as he came through the longhouse door, flanked by Ingólfr. There was a woman with a fire-steel and a smaller lump of material in her hands, striking a fire for the hearth.

"In there," Ingólfr said.

Ljörn dumped the sticks into it, and the woman struck her fire-steel again. A spark happened and the hearth caught fire.

They cooked up a pot of stew. It was a combination of goat milk, eggs, and some of the dried fish they had brought. When the stew in the pot was done, they took turns and filled their bowls with some of it.

Ljörn returned to his seat, his hand with a bowl of the stew. He was hungry for a meal that wasn't dried salted fish, even though he knew the stew had the fish he ate on the boat.

"Finally, food that isn't fish!" Alfrir said, sitting on his box with his bowl. "Smells fine too, don't you think?"

Ljörn wasn't as satisfied as his brother. He was looking into his. The stew was milky white with a bit of yellow from the yolk. "There's still fish in the bowl," he muttered.

"Yes, but this one's got eggs," Alfrir said.

Then Hjalvir stood up, walking to the end of the hearth. He raised his bowl and bellowed, "Friends, before we start our dinner, hear me dearly!"

Ljörn looked at Hjalvir. He hadn't started eating, but wasn't expecting there to be an announcement.

Once everyone turned their heads to Hjalvir, he continued, "Far from Iceland we have sailed! Even now we have not our tools, but soldiers of Randúlfr we are no more! Þórr has seen our struggle, and given this warm soup we have been, now we can relish in it!"

There was a cheer, and they began. It was warm and tasted different, and the chunks of fish were at the bottom. Ljörn quickly ate it all.

Once all the throng were all finished, the room quieted down again. Bowls were put away, and Ljörn also put his back into his box.

Sága continued her tale of Jóki. Ljörn forced himself to listen through it, no matter how repulsive he felt. He wasn't the type to get caught up in tales like these, but for some reason, he couldn't calm down. As the story continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid. The silence outside was killing him.

As the story continued, Ljörn found himself increasingly paranoid. The silence outside was killing him.

"Then Yngvarr stumbled and tripped over his feet. The draugr stood over him, and he slashed him dead!" Sága said.

Ljörn couldn't take it anymore. But he didn't yell nor shout, but he stared into the fire, watching it dance like the great, burning Sól...

*It wasn’t a fire, burning in a hearth. It was the sky. The vast, blue heavens, of which held Sól. Ljörn found himself back at the ruins again. Ingwaz swung its atgeir at him. Ljörn tried to block its blow, but it was so strong that his shield split into two. Beaten by its strength, he stumbled onto the ground.*

*Ljörn shifted backwards, the corpse advancing towards him as it brandished its atgeir. His shield was broken in his hand. His spear was dropped. His sword was still unsheathed.*

*The draugr stood over him and raised its weapon, ready to strike Ljörn dead. It cleaved its blade towards him, but he raised his shield again. His shield's boss met the blade, deflecting it to the side.*

*The draugr raised its weapon again, for sure to kill him now. But just before the smite, his accomplice slashed it from the face to the stomach. It lived, and Ljörn was alone again.*

Ljörn jolted and squirmed as if trying to scatter back to his feet.

"Ljörn, stop that!" Alfrir whispered. He put both hands on Ljörn's shoulders, keeping him from squirming. A few people took a glance at them, and returned their minds to Sága's tale.

Ljörn was breathing heavily. He looked at Alfrir. "Nightmare," he lied. But even with Alfrir now thinking he had a nightmare, that didn't calm him down. He got that uneasy feeling of being followed again. He looked at both sides, at the windows and at the door, at the back and behind the boxes, and in the ceiling where the logs supported the roof; but he couldn't find the ghostly figure anywhere.

"Don't lie," Alfrir said. "You had the same thing on the boat. I know you were awake, so don't fool me now."

Ljörn glanced at Alfrir. He was upset, but he didn't defend himself. "Get off me," he sharply said. His heart was beating like he was sprinting a moment ago.

Alfrir hesitated, then sat back down.

Ljörn started to doubt their luck and started thinking about their woes. His paranoia started to grow on him. "I need to see the seeress," he said. "Where is she?"

"I... she's outside," Alfrir said.

Ljörn looked around the room. Like Alfrir said, she wasn't in the hall. This time, without a fuss, he stood up. He slung his shield around his back, took an unlit torch stick, and stuck it in the hearth. When it caught fire, he held it up and left the longhouse.

The cold breeze hit his face when he pushed the door open. He closed the door behind him as gently as he could, but his anxiety didn't make it easy. Once the door closed shut, he stepped away from the longhouse and looked out into the yonder grasslands. His torch gave him light so he could see, its flames warm and flickering. There was no one in sight. But when he looked towards the forest, he froze.

It was the wolves. There were about a dozen of them moving through the trees and shrubs. They noticed him. Ljörn panicked, but then he saw them hesitate. And they continued on, ignoring Ljörn even when he was alone out in the open. Perhaps it was the fire-torch he was holding that discouraged them.

Ljörn turned around to the shore, hoping he would find her there instead. And as he slowly walked there and reached the edge of the meadow, he saw the Völva.

There she was on the sand, gazing out into the ocean as if she was consulting the gods on the weather. She was in a dark dress and a deer pelt cloak. And the most shamanic thing about her, a crooked staff that she held with several beads and skulls hanging from the end. In front of her, there was a small fire that burned sticks and grass gathered from around.

When Ljörn saw her, he hesitated. He thought he felt a bit of fear boil in his heart, but ignored it and approached her. As he neared her, he saw that the skulls on her staff were of ravens and owls, and the beads were all made of the richest ambers he had seen.

And then Ljörn said, "I seek our woes."

The Völva turned around. When Ljörn saw her face, her eyes were covered by a thin, dark cloth. She wore the claw of a bear on her head like a necklace, and the real necklace she wore around her neck was strung full of fangs and talons.

"Do you?" the Völva questioned him. "To seek the woes of this land, this stead, or the lead?"

Confused, Ljörn didn't know what she was talking about.

"Well?" she asked.

Ljörn wasn't sure what he was paranoid of, so he said, "The woes of this land."

"Then you must pay," she said. She pointed at a nearby bush. "Bring me the head and tail!"

Ljörn, still confused, looked at the bush. Was there something in it? He picked up a large pebble and threw it into the bush. Nothing came out. He inched closer to it, his shield ready and his torch held like a sword. The breeze seemed cooler the closer he got to the bush.

A blur sprung out of it and hit Ljörn's shield! He flinched and took a step back, looking over his shield to see what had hit it. Then, he saw a long creature. It was covered in scales and had a lizard-like head. It had beady eyes and its pupils were slits. It looked like Jörmungandr, but smaller like a rodent. It hissed at him and coiled, warning him to stay back.

He was disgusted. He had never seen a creature like it before, even with his experience of exploring forests at his homeland. He lobbed his torch at the creature with all his might, and hit it right.

But that made the creature more aggressive. It slithered after him. He backed away, looking around for any more projectiles to throw at the thing. He found a rock and picked it up, and with it he threw it at the creature. He missed.

The creature sprung at him again and held onto his shield. With a surprise, Ljörn dropped it onto the sand and jumped back. He grabbed a handful of sand and threw it all over his dropped shield and the creature. He grabbed another rock and threw it at the creature again, this time striking its head. The creature fell and writhed on the ground. And without waiting, he grabbed his shield and smote it, killing the creature.

Ljörn stepped back to better see it again. He slowly approached it and gave it a nudge with his foot, making sure it was dead. "What is this...?" he whispered to himself as he bent down to look at it closer. He felt an urge to stand up so he wasn't so close to it, but he resisted. This was the creature that he needed to take parts from. He drew his knife and cut its head and tail, leaving the body on the shore.

Ljörn returned to the Völva. He held the creature's appendages in a way so more blood would not get onto his hands. "Here," he quietly said, offering them to her.

The Völva took the creature's appendages and said,  "Ah, the snake's head and tail!"

Ljörn then realised what he killed was a snake. He glanced back at the headless, tailless snake body he left beside the bush which it came out of.

Taking the head and tail, the Völva tossed them into the fire before her. As they caught fire and quickly turned to ash, then she looked into the sky and her eyes went blank. She began to talk in tongues, chanting some old language he never heard or read before. "Nerþuz, Þunraz, Wōðanaz, Frawjaz, jūz mek geb witamaz þanei izwiz wissēz, jūz mek lētō auk spellą! Ek hit blōtą geldō, swa jūz mek frōdī auk Lernas waiwanunz, auk jūz hes walanunz manō!"

The Völva's voice deteriorated, becoming more like the whisper of a raspy old man. She was now speaking cryptically, but this time, Ljörn understood.

*Goblet one may find,*

*sunken in bushes' hind;*

*waken one will be,*

*a corpse none shall see.*

*The ship one will take,*

*mast and full sails fade;*

*but ware the torn red flax,*

*his mind fears and lacks.*

Ljörn was afraid. He had already forgotten what he was so paranoid of before meeting her, and now he had taken several steps back when she had begun her spell. And she is still going, her speech back to that ancient tongue.

The Völva finished her chanting and ended her trance-like state. She stared into Ljörn's eyes and asked one word. "Know you then, or what?"

"Yes, yes," Ljörn blurted out. He shot her a nervous smile and quickly left her alone on the beach.

Ljörn hurried back to the longhouse, eager to get away from the völva as soon as possible. But when he stopped at the front door of the house, he thought back on what the Völva said. He could only remember the part where she said, "waken one will be, a corpse none shall see." He shivered.

Ljörn looked at the shore again. The Völva snuffed her fire out and was returning to the longhouse. Looking to the side, Hjalvir's ship was tied to a stake in the ground by its mast. It sat there, lifted up from the sand and placed back down by the water.

The Völva was heading back to the longhouse. Quickly hiding in the bushes, he waited for the Völva to pass by and enter the house. He creeped through the wild grass towards the boat. He stuck his head out and glanced around. No one was on watch. He looked at the boat again.

"Maybe I can cut the rope and wait for the high tide, or..." he thought. Looking at the boat again, he planned on how he would make an escape. Then, his hopes fell. The boat's sails were torn!
