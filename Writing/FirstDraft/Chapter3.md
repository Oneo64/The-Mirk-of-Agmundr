# Chapter 3: Tree and Lyng
After dagmal, Ljörn and Alfrir began felling trees. The forest was right beside them, yet they lingered at the edge. Ljörn swung his axe, chipping away the tree log. They went on for a while until they heard a creak within the stump.

"It's... it's falling!" Ljörn called out, warning anyone nearby to watch out. He hit it again, and the tree wobbled, then bent, and with a rustling crash, fell to the ground. They surrounded the tree's crown, cleaving off the branches and tossing them to the side. Once the tree was bare, both of them, and two other men, all lifted the trunk and carried it back to the farmstead.

Before their journey, Ljörn was a woodcutter and a farmer. Splitting firewood and pulling weeds were his work; occasionally, he would help Alfrir fell trees and carry them back home. But after they took the fallen tree back to the farmstead, he could call himself an explorer, because a messenger came.

"Dan, the leader wills you," said the messenger. "And him," he added, gesturing to Alfrir.

Dan was a common honourific, and yet, Ljörn had never been addressed like that. He glanced at his brother, then back at the messenger. "Hjalvir?" he asked. "Where is he?"

"He's in the hall," the messenger said. "He's gathering a group to go into the forest."

At the messenger's words, Ljörn got the feeling it wouldn't end well. Even though he'd take peaceful walks in the forest, he always avoided getting near the deeper, darker parts of the forest; he was afraid of them. And looking into the forest nearby, it looked a little darker than the ones he was used to.

Alfrir, excited at the messenger's news, turned his attention to him. "I need to attend too?" he asked with anticipation.

The messenger nodded. "Yes, you do too," he said. "Um... There's another one I must tell, so good luck."

Hurriedly, the messenger left them there. Ljörn hesitated at the thought of going, but remembered it was by Hjalvir's request.

"Let's go," Alfrir said, heading for the community hall first.

<!-- scenario: inside hall !-->

Pushing through the doors of the hall, they found Hjalvir and Sága, and someone else standing closely in a corner. They made their way to them and gathered there. "If you find anything strange, don't mess with it. Something might—"

They stopped talking as they noticed Ljörn and Alfrir join them.

"You're here now," Hjalvir said. "We're now waiting for another, she should be here in a moment."

Ljörn said nothing, but nodded to show his understanding.

Sága was standing there, almost proudly as she held her helmet. She looked eager, like Alfrir, to fare into the forest for the undiscovered.

When Ljörn turned his gaze to the other man, he was one whom Ljörn had never seen nor met. This man, whom he saw, was boldly dressed in a bear-hide cloak, displaying his ferocity. His hair was long and dark, like Alfrir’s. Perhaps it was the way he held himself, but Ljörn didn’t like him.

"Dan, why did you summon me?" Ljörn asked, turning back to Hjalvir. "I'm only a farmer."

"Farmer? Hah!" Hjalvir said with a laugh. "Have you not come with weapons and armour? I have heard about your adventure to that ruin. You'll be a good guide for the group, and your brother too." Hjalvir turned to the bear-cloaked man, and continued, "You will lead the group. You are called...?"

"Ingólfr," said bear-cloaked man.

Ljörn bowed his head, understanding his place in the group. He was still hesitant, but decided to go along with them. He wouldn't dare defy Hjalvir. "I'll go and don my armour," he said.

Leaving them temporarily, Ljörn found his kist. His byrnie was lying in a pile like loose rings. His helmet was there too, a conical shape with a guard for his nose. He started by doffing his baldric. Then he wore his byrnie, tying a second belt to secure it to his waist. He picked his cloak up and wrapped it around himself, securing it with a circular brooch. After he was done with that, he donned his baldric over his byrnie, and finally, fitted his helmet atop his head.

He had to admit, wearing his armour again made him feel safe. He shifted a bit, making sure he was comfortable in the ring shirt before joining the rest of the party.

Once back, he glanced at Alfrir, who still hadn't gotten into his armour. "Go don yours," he muttered.

"Right. I'll be back," Alfrir said, and left them to wear his armour. His set was similar to Ljörn’s, except for a few things that were different: he had a hauberk instead of a byrnie, his helmet had eye rings, like a spangenhelm, and he didn't have a sword. Such a helmet like that would make a warrior look terrifying. But when Alfrir wore it, his boyish eyes made being afraid of him confusing.

When they all gathered, Ljörn, Alfrir, Sága, and Ingólfr, that was when the doors opened. A woman came in. She closed the door, careful not to make a bang. She walked towards them, her stride telling Ljörn she wasn’t very flamboyant at all.

She wore a blue dress that reached to the middle of her calves, and a yellow, frayed cloak with a couple of brooches. She had wavy brown hair, green almond eyes, and a light splatter of freckles across her face. Notably, she kept a distance from everyone else, yet enough to say she was with the party.

"Ah, the herbalist," Hjalvir said, greeting the newcomer. "I assume you know what you'll be?"

The woman glanced at Hjalvir. "Y-yes," she said.

Satisfied, Hjalvir continued what he was saying earlier. "Now that everyone has gathered, remember. If you find anything strange, don't mess with it. We have no power over what... over what witchcraft may happen."

"You are not coming?" Sága asked.

"No," Hjalvir said. "I need to stay behind and oversee the farmers. You can go now."

<!-- scenario: forest !-->

With that, the group of five left the longhouse and headed towards the woods. The forest was darker than Ljörn expected, trees taller to cast shadows over the ground. The earth was uneven, sloping upwards to a hill. Croaks of ravens echoed, and as they passed a tree, the flapping of wings. Ljörn strode near to the group, although he was last. He now had his spear, and he held it protectively close. There was a snap, and he flinched, glancing at it; it was only a fox.

The herbalist was also startled by the fox. It dashed away, disappearing into the vegetation.

Ingólfr was leading, flanked by Alfrir and Sága. Besides Ljörn, the only one behind them was the herbalist. And she was quiet too, not speaking much. Ljörn followed the group, listening as the three conversed amongst themselves in the front. It was small talk, and he wasn't very interested in it until Sága asked, "Is it true that he is cursed?"

"Cursed?" Alfrir said, repeating Sága's words. "What are you implying?"

"I'm saying back at our village, I saw him panic at the sight of a guard at eve, like he had seen a ghost," she said.

Alfrir glanced back at Ljörn, who shot him a blank look. "Do not defile him like that," he said with disdain.

Sága's gossip didn't make Ljörn feel better. It was a bit bold for his liking, hearing her call him bewitched. Taking a breath, he glanced around again, eyes darting to the silhouettes of trees, making sure there wasn't anything in the distance. As his gaze was to the side, he heard the herbalist speak.

"Are you really?" she hesitantly asked.

"Really what?" Ljörn asked.

"Emm... well..." she said, trailing off at his question.

Ljörn stayed silent, reluctant to answer her. He glanced at her. "What's your name?" he asked, trying to change the subject.

"I'm Rúna," she said.

"Ljörn," he simply responded. For a while, he was silent. He could still hear faint rustling in the trees, wind blowing through the woods, and now with each step, a crunch came. He kept on with the group, now walking with his spear like a walking stick.

It hadn't been long walking in the forest until they came across a glade. The grass had gotten taller, but not enough to reach their knees. Shrubs with black-colored berries grew there next to another small cliff, making the clearing seem lusher than it was.

"We rest here," Ingólfr said.

And so they stopped there for a rest. Alfrir sat down on a rock, and Sága did too, but Ljörn didn't sit to rest. Wandering around, he walked along the edge of the clearing. When he walked near the berry bushes, he noticed that they looked odd. Picking one with his hand, he sniffed it, went to Alfrir, and showed him the berry. "Look at this," he said.

Alfrir took the berry and looked at it too. "These look like blueberries," he said.

It seemed like the berry bush had also gotten Rúna's attention. She had a sprig in her hand, curiously examining the berries on it. "This is new," she muttered.

"What's that?" Sága asked.

"It's... I don't know," Alfrir said. "It's some kind of berry."

Sága looked perplexed. "What's so interesting? They are just blueberries."

"Blueberries don't look like this, these are more like olives," Alfrir said.

Just like that, their banter over whether those berries were blueberries continued, until finally, Sága decided to taste them. She plucked another one, slit it with her knife, and put a drop onto her tongue. She said no more after that.

Rúna gathered some of the berries into a small cloth sack she brought. With her seax (it was shorter than Ljörn's, more of an eating knife), she carefully cut the sprigs and let their fruit fall into the bag she held underneath.

After their rest, Ingólfr led them deeper. They reached the top of the hill, and there they saw the border to another forest. It was mirkier, darker, with denser trees, some of which had gone lopsided from bad weather. Heather sprouted from the ground, and a faint haze lay in the distance. A few birds flew by, although they had stopped chirping.

A dead pine tree had fallen, completely uprooted by what seemed to be a storm. And there it laid on a great mound. This mound wasn't like a hill; it was too round and too unnatural, sticking out like a sore thumb.

Ljörn’s gaze lingered upon the mound for a moment. He then got an idea of what it might be, a grave of someone, but thinking about it made his heart unpleasantly race. He reached out and tapped Alfrir on the shoulder, and gestured at the mound. "What's that?"

Alfrir glanced in the direction Ljörn pointed out, not seeing the uncanny mound. "Are you seeing things again?"

"No, I'm not. Look over there," Ljörn said, pointing at it again. "That hill."

Taking a second glance, Alfrir finally noticed the mound that Ljörn had seen. "Wait, I see it now," he said. Then, he turned to the other two and said, "Hey, look over there! Do you see that?"

Ingólfr and Sága both stopped in their tracks to look at the unnatural mound. "Did the cheiftain not warn us of witchcraft?" he asked with uncertainty.

"We might find something good," Sága said.

Ljörn huffed. He was starting to regret telling Alfrir about what he saw.

"Fine," Ingólfr said.

Ljörn stopped there, watching them willingly go towards the mound. He was unsure whether to follow or not; the mirky forest's presence overwhelmed him, getting to his unease. He cast a sideways glance, and saw that Rúna also stayed behind. She clutched her bag, watching them go towards it.

Their gaze met. He could see the same uncertainty in her eyes; the forest's ominous presence affected her as well.

Steeling himself, Ljörn gripped his spear with both hands and decided to advance towards the unnatural mound along with the others. Rúna followed after.

Ingólfr showed no sign of fear as he led them along the foot of the mound. They circled it, not stepping onto the slope of the hill. Oddly enough, no trees grew on the mound.

The land flattened as they continued going around the mound. The grass looked dryer, even malnourished, compared to the other parts of the forest floor. Ljörn saw a rusty axe head lying on the side of the hill. He shivered, breathed, and glanced at the nearby shrub as if someone might be hiding in there.

Then there was a shout. Alfrir was bent over, pointing at a shiny, metallic object in the grass. "I found something," he called to the others.

Ljörn went and looked at what Alfrir had found. It was a bronze goblet. There were smooth, dark gems embedded on it, most likely obsidian. The goblet was half-corroded, but it looked like it could still be drunk from.

Ingólfr, who had seen it too, glanced around their surroundings. "Wait," he said, stopping Alfrir before he could pick it up. "Search around first," he said. Looking towards Ljörn and the herbalist, who were still the last two in the group, he continued, "You two, come here and watch the goblet."

Hesitant to leave his finding, Alfrir left and joined Sága as she followed Ingólfr's orders. Stiffly, Rúna shifted towards the goblet and stood there. Whilst the others searched to ensure the goblet wasn't a part of a trap, Ljörn watched over the goblet. He tapped it with the bottom shaft of his spear. Nothing happened.

Glancing to the side, Ljörn saw Rúna as she held the edge of her cloak, feeling its fray.

They looked behind trees, bushes, and foliage. Sága stepped through a patch of tall grass and disappeared out of sight. After a bit of searching, a loud rustle came from her direction.

Ingólfr glanced over his shoulder and turned in the direction of the sound. His hand went to the pommel of his sword, and he shouted, “What was that?”

"It's only a squirrel!" Sága answered. She stepped back out of the bushes, brushing off her tunic.

After a short while, Alfrir returned to the goblet. "There isn't anything here," he said. Then, without waiting any more, he reached for it.

"W-wait—" Ljörn said, raising his hand to stop his brother from touching the goblet.

But Alfrir had already picked the goblet up. Surprisingly, nothing bad happened to him. He tucked the goblet into his belt and readjusted his cloak, concealing it behind the blue cloth.
