# Chapter 3: The Völva
When the next morning came, it was a boring day. The wolves were gone and so Hjalvir, the man who led them, paired Ljörn with Ingólfr to go into the forest for firewood. Ingólfr had made it clear that Ljörn should carry the sticks (for the fire since they had no felling-axes) while he himself gathered them.

Now, it is night time again. The fire was brighter than before.

Sága continued her tale of Jóki. Ljörn forced himself to listen through it, no matter how repulsive he felt.

As the story continued, Ljörn found himself increasingly paranoid. The silence outside was killing him.

"Then Yngvarr stumbled and tripped over his feet. The draugr stood over him, and he slashed him dead!" Sága said.

Ljörn couldn't take it anymore. But he didn't yell nor shout, but he stared into the fire, watching it dance like the great, burning Sól...

*It wasn’t a fire, burning in a hearth. It was the sky. The vast, blue heavens, of which held Sól. Ljörn found himself back at the ruins again. Ingwaz swung its atgeir at him. Ljörn tried to block its blow, but it was so strong that his shield split into two. He stumbled to the ground and shifted backwards, watching the corpse advance onto him. His shield was broken in his hand. His spear was dropped. His sword was still unsheathed.*

*The draugr stood over him and raised its weapon, ready to strike Ljörn dead. It cleaved its blade towards him, but he raised his shield again. His shield’s boss met the blade, deflecting it to the side.*

*The draugr raised its weapon again, for sure to kill him now. But just before the smite, his accomplice slashed it from the face to the stomach. It lived, and Ljörn was alone again.*

Ljörn jolted and squirmed as if trying to scatter back to his feet.

"Ljörn, stop that!" Alfrir whispered. He put both hands on Ljörn's shoulders, keeping him from squirming. A few people took a glance at them, and returned their minds to Sága's tale.

Ljörn was breathing heavily. He looked at Alfrir. "Nightmare," he lied. But even with Alfrir now thinking he had a nightmare, that didn't calm him down. He got that uneasy feeling of being followed again. He looked at both sides, at the windows and at the door, at the back and behind the boxes, and in the ceiling where the logs supported the roof; but he couldn’t find the ghostly figure anywhere.

"Don't lie," Alfrir said. "You had the same thing on the boat. I know you were awake, so don't fool me now."

Ljörn glanced at Alfrir. He was upset, but he didn't defend himself. "Get off me," he sharply said. His heart was beating like he was sprinting a moment ago.

Alfrir hesitated, then sat back down.

Ljörn started to doubt their luck and started thinking about their woes. His paranoia started to grow on him. "I need to see the seeress," he said. "Where is she?"

"I... she's outside," Alfrir said. "I think."

Ljörn looked around the room. Like Alfrir said, she wasn't in the hall. This time, without a fuss, he stood up. He took a torch stick and stuck it in the hearth. When it caught fire, he held it up and left the longhouse.

The cold breeze hit his face when he pushed the door open. He closed the door behind him as gently as he could, but his anxiety didn't make it easy. Once the door closed shut, he stepped away from the longhouse and looked out into the yonder grasslands. His torch gave him light so he could see, its flames warm and flickering. There was no one in sight. But when he looked towards the forest, he froze.

It was the wolves. There were about a dozen of them moving through the trees and shrubs. They noticed him. Ljörn panicked, but then he saw them hesitate. And they continued on, ignoring Ljörn even when he was alone out in the open. Perhaps it was the fire-torch he was holding that discouraged them.

Ljörn turned around to the shore, hoping he would find her there instead. And as he slowly walked there and reached the edge of the meadow, he saw the Völva.

She was on the sand, gazing out into the ocean as if she was consulting Njörðr on the weather. She was in a dark dress and a deer pelt cloak. And the most shamanic thing about her, a crooked staff that she held with several beads and skulls hanging from the end.

When Ljörn saw her, he hesitated. He thought he felt a bit of fear boil in his heart, but ignored it and approached her. As he neared her, he saw that the skulls on her staff were of ravens and owls, and the beads were all made of the richest ambers he had seen.

And then Ljörn said, "I seek our woes."

The Völva turned around. When Ljörn saw her face, her eyes were covered by a thin, dark cloth. She wore the claw of a bear on her head like a necklace, and the real necklace she wore around her neck was strung full of fangs and talons.

"Do you?" the Völva questioned him. "To seek the woes of this land, this stead, or the lead?"

Confused, Ljörn didn't know what she was talking about.

Then she looked into the sky and her eyes went blank. She began to talk in tongues, chanting some old language he never heard or read before. "Nerþuz, Þunraz, Wōðanaz, Frawjaz, jūz mek geb witamaz þanei izwiz wissēz, jūz mek lētō auk spellą! Jūz mek frōdī auk Lernas waiwanunz, auk jūz hes walanunz manō!"

The Völva's voice deteriorated, becoming more like the whisper of a raspy old man. She was now speaking cryptically, but this time, Ljörn understood.

*Goblet one may find,*

*sunken in bushes' hind;*

*waken one will be,*

*a corpse none shall see.*

*The ship one will take,*

*mast and full sails fade;*

*but ware the torn red flax,*

*his mind fears and lacks.*

Ljörn was afraid. He had already forgotten what he was so paranoid of before meeting her, and now he had taken several steps back when she had begun her spell. And she is still going, her speech back to that ancient tongue.

The Völva finished her chanting and ended her trance-like state. She stared into Ljörn's eyes and asked one word. "Know you then, or what?"

"Yes, yes," Ljörn blurted out. He shot her a nervous smile and quickly left her alone on the beach.
