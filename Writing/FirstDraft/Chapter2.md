# Chapter 2: Night and Swine
<!-- SCENE 1: Hall !-->
Ljörn sat, cross-legged against the wall as he stared into the hearthfire. It was low. Too low. The flames brightened and dimmed, looking as if they were dwindling. The fire provided enough light to see in the dark, yet no warmth could be felt. It was miraculous they got the fire going, since the sticks were wet to begin with.

There was a ghostly sound from the wind blowing past the windows. That's where Ljörn didn't sit under, or else the cold would have worsened his wet clothing. Someone from the other side of the room muffled their cough.

Ljörn was thinking about the second longboat, waiting for their arrival. It had been tens of minutes since they set foot on the new land. Before the storm happened, they were right behind the ship he took. Has it not come yet?

The only tools he had were his seax, still in his sheath. And like many other warriors in the room, his shield. He didn't have his helmet, his byrnie, or his spear. His shield was the only thing that comforted him, the only thing that provided comfort through protection.

Most of the throng had fallen asleep, but the warriors were restless. From the quiet chatter in the room, Ljörn could tell they were worried about the same thing.

There were only a few available chairs. Hjalvir sat on one, the others reserved for Sága and a few other well-dressed men. Sága was reading through a book, which she had preserved from the rain.

Alfrir was beside Ljörn. He always sat like that when he wasn't wistful. He kept glancing at the group of the well-dressed men, as if he was thinking to talk about them.

"See them?" Alfrir started, whispering. He nodded in their direction.

Ljörn looked at the people his brother was talking about. He was right. His brother was going to talk about them.

"Yes," Ljörn responded, his voice low like Alfrir's.

"Look at the man's helmet," his brother said. "Nice find, no?"

The warrior he was talking about was wearing a helmet. It was one of those English helmets, with the cheek armour and the brass lining.

"I never seen one like it," Alfrir added.

As they talked, Hjalvir stood up and paced around the room. He stopped by the sea-facing window and peered out into the ocean. He was worried about the same thing Ljörn was worried about.

"Where are those fools?" Hjalvir said. "They were behind us!"

Hjalvir looked away from the window and scanned the various people in the shelter. Ljörn instantly knew what he was thinking and hoped it wasn't going to be him. Hjalvir skipped all the women and children, and the men who were too weak to step out at this time. Then his gaze landed on a particular one.

The man, whom Hjalvir had seemed to choose, was dressed in the thickest amount of clothing Ljörn had ever seen, twice as much as he would bother to wear. Dressed in a bear cloak without the head, a dark brown tunic he was (although the dim made it seem black), his long brown hair was like that of Alfrir's, except with glory. Ljörn didn't like him already.

"I don't remember you joining me. You are called...?" Hjalvir asked, impressed at the man's boldness to wear so much.

The man raised his head, eyes locking onto Hjalvir's. "Ingólfr," the man said.

"Ingólfr," Hjalvir repeated. "You seem prepared. You are to go to the shore and seek the second ship."

Ingólfr bowed his head once. He left the hall, leaving it quiet again.

Sága stood, closing the book she was reading. She went to Hjalvir and talked to him in a quiet voice Ljörn couldn't hear. After a bit of talking, she turned to everyone else in the room.

"I have a tale to tell!" Sága announced. The chatter quieted down, and the warriors, who were still awake, turned their attention to her. She pulled her chair closer to the hearth, sitting down as she continued. "I announce to you all! Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni, the tale of which Jóki, he and Yngvarr..."

"Draugrinn..." The word echoed in Ljörn's mind. He then felt ill, reminded of an unsavoury past. He quickly stood from where he sat. "S-sorry, I... I feel ill," he stammered, making himself an excuse to leave. He grabbed his shield and hastily made for the front door. Someone shouted at him to come back, but he ignored them.

<!-- SCENE 2: Outside !-->
The grass was still swaying in the wind when Ljörn came out. The rain, now lightly showering, made a rustling sound in the grass. The moon was the only light source, making the landscape hauntingly beautiful. But despite the prettiness of the land, he began to feel like he was being followed. He breathed heavily. He looked left and right, but no matter how hard he looked, there wasn't a single sign of danger.

A distinctive rustle came from the tall grass. His eyes darted to the bush, but saw nothing in them.

A voice questioned him. "What are you doing?"

Ljörn looked to the side and flinched. Ingólfr had returned from his scouting mission, and is now standing before him.

"I felt ill," Ljörn lied.

"You should be sleeping then," Ingólfr responded. His tone didn't carry any suspicion.

Ljörn was going to say he couldn't fall asleep because of his lack of defence, but when he opened his mouth to speak, he heard movement in the bushes. He was sure this time it wasn't the rain or the wind. They sharply turned, eyes searching and scanning the grass of which the sound came from.

The door opened with a slight creak. "Ljörn what are you-" Alfrir stopped himself as he saw what they were looking at.

There was a wild boar, dangerously close to the three. It wasn't like the domestic pigs they kept back at their village. This boar was about a half times bigger, and grew dark-colored fur and hardy tusks protruding from its mouth. Alfrir closed the door behind him, slowly stepping beside them.

"Shoo!" Ingólfr said, attempting to make the boar leave. It didn't go away.

Ljörn drew his seax, sensing a confrontation. Ingólfr did the same. Alfrir also drew his knife, prepared to attack if the pig did. There was a silent moment when only the rain and their breaths could be heard.

The boar postured. Alfrir, seeing that it was going to attack, impulsively jumped at the boar. Alfrir landed on it, smashing his shield into the boar, his hands on the back of the boar as he stabbed his knife deep into its backside. But it squealed, squirmed, and shook him off.

"Alfrir!" Ljörn exclaimed with surprise, even though he knew charging at a wild boar was a move Alfrir would do.

The boar switched targets and charged at Ljörn. He lowered his shield. It rammed into the metal boss, its tusks denting both sides of the shield. Ljörn's hand hurt, his shield collapsing into his chest as the two staggered backwards, although the swine was more disoriented. Ljörn was put down on his rear, and he sat watching as the boar stood there, dumbfounded by what it had hit.

Ljörn and Alfrir scattered to their feet. Ingólfr stepped towards the boar, kicking its underside with all his might, sending it to the ground. He tackled it, trying to pin it to the ground. Alfrir helped him and stabbed the swine in the face. There was what looked to be a wrestling match between the two men and the wild animal, but they couldn't pin it down, mud and rainwater on the boar's coat making it difficult.

Ljörn stepped closer, watching the boar squirming, its hooves kicking and stomping all over the two men. "Augh," Alfrir groaned, and rolled away from the fight.

The boar easily broke free from Ingólfr's grapple. It got to its feet again, now with both Ingólfr and Alfrir on the ground. But Ljörn was already on the other side. He bashed his shield into the swine, disorienting it again.

Alfrir retreated. He was doubled over and was staggering a bit. His tunic was torn and a buise colored his stomach. Ingólfr, however, was fine. His thick clothing protected him from the boar's hooves. Ingólfr closed the distance attempting to slash the swine. But it rammed into Ingólfr, and took him towards the community hall's door.

<!-- SCENE 3: Hall again !-->
The boar crashed through the door of the community hall, sending Ingólfr flying inside. He landed into the hearth, his clothing covering the fire and plundging the room into darkness.

Chaos exploded inside the hall. People gasped, others swore, grabbing their candles and lanterns trying to get the flicker of flame to brighten the room again. The boar ran into chairs, pots, chests, stones of the hearth, going into a frenzy as it tried to escape the confines of the community hall. Ljörn and Ingólfr ran inside.

"I've got it!" someone yelled. "I see- oof!" someone else shouted. With every thump there was a squeal, with every bump there was a yell, and then Hjalvir lit his stone lamp. The light of his lamp filled the room, and there the boar was, cornered at the end of the hall.

"Andskotar!" Hjalvir uttered, surprised to see the wild animal in their hall.

Someone stepped out from the throng. His bow was aimed at the boar. He drew an arrow. As soon as the boar slowed down, exhausted, he let the arrow loose, piercing right into its skull. The boar stiffened, made a small squeal, and collapsed dead.

Hjalvir turned to the crowd of people behind him. "Who led it in?" He questioned, his tone grown stern. There was silence. No one dared to answer.

The bowman spoke. "I must say that when the pig came in, the one in the blue tunic was the only one standing other than him." He nodded Ljörn's direction.

Hjalvir glanced at his direction. But Ingólfr caught his attention instead. Ingólfr lifted Alfrir straight by his underarms, taking him back into the room. If it weren't for Ingólfr, Alfrir would still be doubled over, maimed by being hit in the stomach. "He's hurt, Hjalvir."

<!-- SCENE 4: Alfrir !-->
Alfrir was laid upon a hay-bed. He was laid closer to the hearth where the warmth could be felt. Hjalvir, Ingólfr, and a healer were around him. The healer was gently rubbing a sort of leaf on his wounds.

"What happened?" Hjalvir asked.

"I was attacked," Ingólfr explained, his breath steady despite the recent fight. "There was a boar out the hall. We had to brawl with it, and the swine galloped on his chest."

Hjalvir looked back at Alfrir again. "Leastly we have food," he muttered. "And what about the second ship?"

"I couldn't see it," Ingólfr said. "I watched even when the fog cleared."

Hjalvir turned to Ljörn, knowing he was part of the commotion. His voice was stern again. "And you, explain yourself! Leaving the hall so suddenly? Do you mean to betray us?!"

Ljörn was speechless, but Sága spoke up. "Father, he means no harm. I think he is only cursed. Back at our village, I saw him panic at the sight of a guard at eve, like he had seen a ghost."

Hjalvir stared at Ljörn. He slowly regained his calm, seeming to see reason with Sága's explaination.

Ljörn slowly approached Alfrir. As he laid eyes upon him, he saw his wound and grimaced at the sight of the large bruise on his stomach. "Will he live?"

"He will," said the healer.

Alfrir glanced at Ljörn. He let out a chuckle. "Ugh... nasty thing," he commented, his voice almost like a groan. "It's gone done me."

Hjalvir paused for a moment as he thought of what to do with them. He took a look at Alfrir, then Ljörn and Ingólfr. "You two, go rest," Hjalvir said, dismissing both the two who stood by Alfrir.

That night, Ljörn laid next to the wall away from the windows. He slept lightly, still unable to get the defencelessness out of his mind. And the cold of the night didn't help.
