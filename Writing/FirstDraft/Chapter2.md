# Chapter 2: Defenseless in the Night
<!-- SCENE 1: The Community Hall !-->
Ljörn sat, slumped against the wall as he looked into the hearthfire. It was low. Too low. The flames brightened and dimmed, looking as if they were dwindling. The fire provided enough light to see in the dark, yet no warmth could be felt. It was miraculous they got the fire burning, since the sticks were wet to begin with.

There was a ghostly sound by the wind blowing past the windows, making the cold seem colder. Someone muffled their cough.

Ljörn waited for the second longboat to arrive. Has it not come yet? The only tools he had were his seax, still in his sheath. And like many other warriors in the room, his shield. He didn't have his helmet, his byrnie, or his spear. His shield was the only thing that comforted him, the only thing that provided comfort through protection.

Most of the throng had fallen sleep, but the warriors were restless. From the quiet chatter in the room, Ljörn could tell they were worried about the same thing.

There were only a few available chairs. Hjalvir sat on one, the others reserved for Sága and a few other well-dressed men. Sága was reading through a book, which she preserved from the rain.

Alfrir was beside Ljörn. He always sat like that when he wasn't wistful. He kept glancing at the group of the well-dressed men, as if he was thinking to talk about them.

"See them?" Alfrir started, whispering. He nodded in their direction.

Ljörn looked at the people his brother was talking about. He was right. "Yes," he said, his voice low like Alfrir's.

"I aspire to be them," his brother said. "I mean of, look at the man's helmet."

The warrior he was talking about was wearing a helmet. It was one of those English helmets, with the cheek armour and the brass lining.

"I never seen one like it," Alfrir added.

Hjalvir stood up and paced around the room. He stopped by the sea-facing window and peered out into the ocean. He was worried about the same thing Ljörn was worried about.

"Where are those fools?" Hjalvir said. "They were behind us!"

Hjalvir looked away from the window and scanned the various people in the shelter. Ljörn instantly knew what he was thinking and hoped it wasn't going to be him. Hjalvir skipped all the women and children, and the men too weak to step out at this time. Then his gaze landed on a particular one.

The man, who Hjalvir had seemed to choose, was dressed in the thickest amount of clothing Ljörn had ever seen, twice as much as he would bother to wear. Dressed in a bear cloak without the head, a dark brown tunic he was (although the dim made it seem black), his long brown hair was like those of Alfrir's, except with glory. Ljörn didn't like him already.

"I don't remember you joining me. You are called...?" Hjalvir asked, impressed at the man's boldness to wear so much.

The man raised his head, eyes locking onto Hjalvir's. "Ingólfr," the man said.

"Ingólfr," Hjalvir repeated. "You seem prepared. You are to go to the shore and seek the second ship."

Ingólfr bowed his head once. He left the hall, leaving it quiet again.

Sága stood, closing the book she was reading. She went to Hjalvir and talked to him in quiet voices Ljörn couldn't hear. Then she turned to everyone else in the room.

"I have a tale to tell!" Sága announced. The chatter quieted down, and the warriors, who were still awake, turned their attentions to her. She pulled her chair closer to the hearth, sitting down as she continues. "I announce to you all! Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni, the tale of which Jóki, he and Yngvarr..."

And as she continued, Ljörn quickly stood from where he sat. "S-sorry, I... I feel ill," he stammered, making himself an excuse to leave. He grabbed his shield and hastily made for the front door.

The grass was still swaying in the wind when Ljörn came out. The rain, now lightly showering, made a rustling sound in the grass. The moon was the only light source, making the landscape seem hauntingly beautiful. But despite the prettiness of the land, he began to feel like he was being followed. He looked left and right, but no matter how hard he looked, there wasn't a single sign of danger.

Then, when Ljörn was least expecting it, a voice questioned him. "What are you doing?"

Ingólfr had returned from his scouting mission, and is now standing before him. "I felt ill," Ljörn lied.

"You should be sleeping then," Ingólfr responded. He didn't seem to carry any suspicion. But his tone was very just.

Ljörn was going to say he couldn't fall asleep because of his lack of defence, but then they heard movement in the bushes. They sharply turned, eyes searching the grass of which the sound came from.

The door opened. "Ljörn what are you-" Alfrir stopped himself as he saw what they were looking at.

There was a boar, dangerously close to the three. It wasn't like the domestic pigs they kept back at their village. Alfrir closed the door behind him. Ljörn drew his seax, and Ingólfr did the same. Alfrir also drew his knife.

There was a silent moment when only the rain and their breaths could be heard. Then the boar postured, and Alfrir, seeing that it was going to attack, jumped at the boar. Alfrir landed on it, smashing his shield into the boar, his hands on the back of the boar as he stabbed his knife deep into its backside. But it squealed, squirmed, and shook him off.

"Alfrir!" Ljörn exclaimed with surprise, even though he knew charging at a wild boar was a move Alfrir would do.

The boar charged at Ljörn. He lowered his shield. The boar rammed into the metal boss, its tusks denting both sides of the shield. Ljörn's hand hurt, his shield collapsing into his chest as the two staggered backwards, although the swine was more disoriented.

Alfrir scattered to his feet. Ingólfr stepped towards the boar, kicking its underside with all his might, sending it to the ground. He then tackled it, with Alfrir using his seax to stab it in the face. The boar squirmed again, its feet maiming both their stomachs as it tried to escape their grapple.

The boar got to its feet again, but Ingólfr, with his thick clothing protecting like armour, was faster. He slashed the boar. Ljörn then collapsed onto the boar, using the shield like a falling hammer onto the top of the boar's head. The boar collapsed again. Ljörn, using the shield, smote the boar again and again.

The three stepped back to see their handiwork. The boar, now lifeless, not even a twitch, with a splatter of blood under where its head laid.
