# Chapter 2: The Völva
<!-- SCENARIO 1: Meal !-->
A pot sat upon the hearth as it boiled softly. Ljörn stared at it, waiting for a meal to be made. There was a ghostly sound from the wind blowing past the windows. That's where he didn't sit under, or else the cold would have worsened his wet clothing. But now with his scabbard by his side, he felt more at ease. As long as he had some protection beside him (his seax wasn’t quite enough), he wouldn’t feel anxious.

Alfrir was beside Ljörn. He always sat like that when he wasn't wistful. He kept glancing at the group of well-dressed men, as if he were thinking to talk about them. "See them?" Alfrir started, whispering. He nodded in their direction.

Ljörn looked at the people his brother was talking about. He was right. His brother was going to talk about them. "Yes," he responded, his voice low like Alfrir's.

"Look at the man's helmet," his brother said. "Nice find, no?"

The warrior he was talking about was wearing a helmet. It was one of those English helmets, with the cheek armour and the brass lining.

"I never seen one like it," Alfrir added.

Their small talk died down. A moment later, the pot began to emit a nice aroma. The stew was a combination of goat milk, eggs, and some of the dried fish they had brought. When the stew in the pot was done, everyone in the room took turns and filled their bowls with some of it.

Ljörn returned to his seat, his hand with a bowl of the stew. He was hungry for a meal that wasn't dried salted fish, even though he knew the stew had the fish from the boat.

"Finally, food that isn't fish!" Alfrir said, sitting on his box with his bowl. "Smells fine too, don't you think?"

Ljörn wasn't as satisfied as his brother. He was looking into his. The stew was milky white with a bit of yellow from the yolk. "There's still fish in the bowl," he muttered.

"Yes, but this one's got eggs," Alfrir said.

Then Hjalvir stood up, walking to the end of the hearth. He raised his bowl and bellowed, "Friends, before we start our dinner, hear me dearly!"

Ljörn looked at Hjalvir. He hadn't started eating, but wasn't expecting there to be an announcement.

Once everyone turned their heads to Hjalvir, he continued, "Far from Iceland we have sailed! Soldiers of Randúlfr we are no more! Þórr has seen our struggle, and given this warm soup we have been, now we can relish in it!"

There was a cheer, and they began. It was warm and tasted different, and the chunks of fish were at the bottom. Ljörn quickly ate it all.

Once all the throng were finished, the room quieted down again. Bowls were put away, and Ljörn also put his back into his box. He had a half-full belly, and that was enough.

<!-- SCENARIO 2: Flashback !-->

He looked across the room and spotted Sága reading through a book, which she had preserved from the rain. He wondered what she was reading.

Then she stood, closing the book she was reading. She went to Hjalvir and talked to him in a quiet voice that Ljörn couldn’t hear. After a bit of talking, she turned to everyone else in the room. “I have a tale to tell!” she announced.

The chatter quieted down, and the warriors, who were still awake, turned their attention to her.

Sága pulled her chair closer to the hearth, sitting down as she continued. "I announce to you all! Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni, the tale of which Jóki, he and Yngvarr..."

As Sága continued on with her tale, Ljörn felt an uneasy feeling growing inside him. He looked away from her and tried to focus on anything other than it. But the word *draugrinn* echoed clearly inside Ljörn’s mind. He wasn't the type to get caught up in tales like these, but for some reason, he couldn't calm down. As the story continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid. The silence outside was killing him.

"Then Yngvarr stumbled and tripped over his feet. The draugr stood over him, and he slashed him dead!" Sága said.

Ljörn couldn’t take it anymore. But he didn’t yell. Nor did he shout or make a scene, but instead he stared into the fire, watching it dance like the great, burning Sól...

*It wasn’t a fire, burning in a hearth. It was the sky. The vast, blue heavens, of which held Sól. Ljörn found himself back at the ruins again. Ingwaz swung its atgeir at him. Ljörn tried to block its blow, but it was so strong that his shield split into two. Beaten by its strength, he stumbled onto the ground.*

*Ljörn shifted backwards, the corpse advancing towards him as it brandished its atgeir. His shield was broken in his hand. His spear was dropped out of reach. His sword was still unsheathed.*

*The draugr stood over him and raised its weapon, ready to strike Ljörn dead. It cleaved its blade towards him, but he raised his shield again. His shield's boss met the blade, deflecting it to the side.*

*The draugr raised its weapon again, for sure to kill him now. But just before the smite, his accomplice slashed it from the face to the stomach. It lived, and Ljörn was alone again.*

Ljörn jolted and squirmed as if trying to scatter back to his feet.

"Ljörn, stop that!" Alfrir whispered. He put both hands on Ljörn's shoulders, keeping him from squirming. A few people glanced at them.

Ljörn was breathing heavily. He looked at Alfrir. "Nightmare," he lied. But even with Alfrir now thinking he had a nightmare, that didn't calm him down. He got that uneasy feeling of being followed again. He looked at both sides, at the windows and at the door, at the back and behind the boxes, and at the ceiling where the logs supported the roof; but he couldn't find the ghostly figure anywhere.

"Don't lie," Alfrir said. "You had the same thing on the boat. I know you were awake, so don't fool me now."

Ljörn glanced at Alfrir. He was upset, but he didn't defend himself. "Get off me," he sharply said. His heart was beating like he was sprinting a moment ago.

Alfrir hesitated, then sat back down.

Ljörn started to doubt their luck and started thinking about their woes. His paranoia started to grow on him. "I need to see the seeress," he said. "Where is she?"

"I... she's outside," Alfrir said.

Ljörn looked around the room. Like Alfrir said, she wasn't in the hall. Without a fuss, he stood up. He slung his shield around his back, took an unlit torch stick, and stuck it in the hearth. When it caught fire, he held it up and left the longhouse.

<!-- SCENARIO 3: Outside and the volva !-->

The cold breeze hit his face when he pushed the door open. He closed the door behind him as gently as he could, but his anxiety didn't make it easy. The rain, now lightly showering, made a rustling sound in the grass. The moon was the only light source, making the landscape hauntingly beautiful. But despite the prettiness of the land, he began to feel like he was being followed. He breathed heavily. His torch gave him light so he could see, its flames warm and flickering. He looked left and right, but no matter how hard he looked, there wasn't a single sign of danger. But when he looked at the forest again, he froze.

There was a pack of wolves. There were about a dozen of them moving through the trees and shrubs. They noticed him. Ljörn panicked, but then he saw them hesitate. And they continued on, ignoring Ljörn even when he was alone out in the open. Perhaps it was the fire-torch he was holding that discouraged them.

Ljörn turned around to the shore, hoping he would find her there instead. And as he slowly walked there and reached the edge of the meadow, he saw the völva.

There she was on the sand, gazing out into the ocean as if she were consulting the gods on the weather. She was in a dark dress and a deer pelt cloak. And the most shamanic thing about her was a crooked staff that she held with several beads and skulls hanging from the end. In front of her, there was a small fire that burned sticks and grass gathered from around.

When Ljörn saw her, he hesitated. He thought he felt a bit of fear boil in his heart, but ignored it and approached her. As he neared her, he saw that the skulls on her staff were of ravens and owls, and the beads were all made of the richest ambers he had seen.

And then Ljörn said, "I seek our woes."

The völva turned around. She was elderly, at least twice as old as he was. She wore the claw of a bear on her head like a necklace, and the real necklace she wore around her neck was strung full of fangs and talons.

"Do you?" the völva questioned him. "To seek the woes of this land, this stead, or the lead?"

Confused, Ljörn didn't know what she was talking about.

"Well?" she asked.

Ljörn wasn't sure what he was paranoid of, so he said, "The woes of this land."

"Then you must pay," she said. She pointed at a nearby bush. "Bring me the head and tail!"

Ljörn, still confused, looked at the bush. Was there something in it? He picked up a large pebble and threw it into the bush. Nothing came out.

He put his torch down, drew his sword, and inched closer to it. He held his shield ready for anything that could come out. The breeze seemed cooler the closer he got to the bush.

A blur sprang out of it and hit Ljörn's shield! He flinched and took a step back, looking over his shield to see what had hit it. Then, he saw a long creature. It was covered in scales and had a lizard-like head. It had beady eyes and its pupils were slits. It looked like Jörmungandr. But it was smaller, like a rodent. It hissed at him and coiled, warning him to stay back.

He was disgusted. He had never seen a creature like it before, even with his experience of exploring forests in his homeland. Not sure whether to hit it with his sword or not, he picked his torch up again and lobbed it at the creature with all his might, hitting it right.

But that made the creature more aggressive. It slithered after him. He swung his sword, but the creature jumped at him again and held onto his shield. With a surprise, he dropped it onto the sand and backed away. 

Ljörn grabbed a handful of sand and threw it all over his dropped shield and the creature. Right after that, he closed in and with a cleave, he chopped it in half.

It writhed, squirmed, and came off his shield. He then picked his shield up and smote the creature, killing it.

Ljörn stepped back to better see it again. He slowly approached it and gave it a nudge with his sword, making sure it was dead. "What is this...?" he whispered to himself as he bent down to look at it closely. He felt an urge to stand up so he wasn't so close to it, but he resisted. This was the creature that he needed to take parts from. He put away his sword and drew a knife. He cut its head and tail, leaving the body on the shore.

Ljörn returned to the völva. He held the creature's appendages in a way so that more blood wouldn't get onto his hands. "Here," he quietly said, offering them to her.

The völva took the creature's appendages and said,  "Ah, the snake's head and tail!"

Ljörn then realised what he had slain was a snake. He glanced back at the headless, tailless snake body he left beside the bush which it came out of.

Taking the head and tail, the völva tossed them into the fire before her. As they caught fire and quickly turned to ash, she looked into the sky, and her eyes went blank. She began to talk in tongues, chanting some old language he had never heard or read before. "Nerþuz, Þunraz, Wōðanaz, Frawjaz, jūz mek geb witamaz þanei izwiz wissēz, jūz mek lētō auk spellą! Ek hit blōtą geldō, swa jūz mek frōdī auk Lernas waiwanunz, auk jūz hes walanunz manō!"

The völva’s voice became more like the whisper of a raspy old man. She was now speaking cryptically, but this time, Ljörn understood.

*Goblet one may find,*

*sunken in bushes' hind;*

*waken one will be,*

*a corpse none shall see.*

Ljörn was afraid. He had already forgotten what he was so paranoid of before meeting her, and now he had taken several steps back when she had begun her spell. And she is still going, her speech back to that ancient tongue.

The völva finished her chanting and ended her trance-like state. She stared into Ljörn's eyes and asked one word. "Know you then, or what?"

"Yes, yes," Ljörn blurted out. He shot her a nervous smile and quickly left her alone on the beach.

Ljörn hurried back to the longhouse, eager to get away from the völva as soon as possible. But when he stopped at the front door of the house, he thought back on what the völva said. He could only remember the part where she said, "waken one will be, a corpse none shall see." He shivered.

Ljörn looked at the shore again. The völva snuffed her fire out and started to return to the longhouse. Looking to the side, Hjalvir's ship was tied to a stake in the ground by its mast. It sat there, lifted from the sand and placed back down by the water.
