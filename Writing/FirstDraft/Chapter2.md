# Chapter 2: Defenseless in Night
<!-- SCENE 1: The Community Hall !-->
Ljörn sat, slumped against the wall as he looked into the hearthfire. It was low. Too low. The flames brightened and dimmed, looking as if they were dwindling, the sticks were still wet from the rain. The fire only provided enough light to see in the dark, and no warmth came out. There was the ghostly sound of the wind blowing past the windows, making the cold seem colder. Someone coughed.

Ljörn waited for the second longboat to arrive. Has it not come yet? The only tools he had were his seax, still in his sheath. And like many other warriors in the room, his shield. Laid against his shoulder, his shield was the only thing that comforted him, keeping him from filling up with vigilance.

Hjalvir sat on the only chairs in the room, the others reserved for Sága and a few other well-dressed men.

Alfrir was beside Ljörn. He wasn't as wistful was himself, Ljörn could tell by the way he sat. Alfrir always sat like that when he wasn't wistful. In fact, Ljörn couldn't think of a time when Alfrir was wistful.

"See them?" Alfrir started, his voice a whisper. He nodded in the direction of the well-dressed men.

Ljörn looked at the people his brother was talking about. "Yes."

"I aspire to be them," his brother said. "I mean of, look at that man's helmet."

The warrior he was talking about was wearing a helmet. It was one of those English helmets, with the cheek armor and the brass lining.

Hjalvir stood up and paced around the room. He stopped by the sea-facing window and peered out into the ocean. "Where are those fools?" Hjalvir said. "I thought they were behind us!"

Hjalvir looked away from the window and scanned the various people in the shelter. Ljörn instantly knew what he was thinking and hoped it wasn't going to be him. Hjalvir skipped all the women and children, and men too weak to step out at this situation. Then his gaze landed on a particular one.

The man, who Hjalvir had seemed to choose, was dressed in the thickest amount of clothing Ljörn had ever seen, twice as much as he would bother to wear. Dressed in a bear cloak without the head, a dark brown tunic he was (although the dim made it seem black), his long brown hair was like those of Alfrir's, except with glory.

"I don't remember you joining me. You are called...?" Hjalvir asked, impressed at the man's boldness to wear so much.

The man raised his head, eyes locking onto Hjalvir's. "Ingólfr," the man said.

"Ingólfr," Hjalvir repeated. "You seem prepared. You are to go to the shore and seek the second ship."

Ingólfr stood, leaving the hall.
