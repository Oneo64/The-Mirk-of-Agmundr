# Chapter 2: Hunting in the Night
<!-- SCENARIO 1: Hall !-->
Ljörn sat, cross-legged against the wall as he stared into the hearthfire. It was low. Too low. The flames brightened and dimmed, looking as if they were dwindling. The fire provided enough light to see in the dark, yet no warmth could be felt. It was miraculous they got the fire going, since the sticks were wet to begin with.

There was a ghostly sound from the wind blowing past the windows. That's where Ljörn didn't sit under, or else the cold would have worsened his wet clothing. Someone from the other side of the room muffled their cough.

Ljörn was thinking about the second longboat, waiting for their arrival. It had been tens of minutes since they set foot on the new land. Before the storm happened, they were right behind the ship he took. Has it not come yet?

The only tools he had were his seax, still in his sheath. And like many other warriors in the room, his shield. He didn't have his helmet, his byrnie, or his spear. His shield was the only thing that comforted him, the only thing that provided comfort through protection.

Most of the throng had fallen asleep, but the warriors were restless. From the quiet chatter in the room, Ljörn could tell they were worried about the same thing.

There were only a few available chairs. Hjalvir sat on one, the others reserved for Sága and a few other well-dressed men. Sága was reading through a book, which she had preserved from the rain.

Alfrir was beside Ljörn. He always sat like that when he wasn't wistful. He kept glancing at the group of well-dressed men, as if he were thinking to talk about them.

"See them?" Alfrir started, whispering. He nodded in their direction.

Ljörn looked at the people his brother was talking about. He was right. His brother was going to talk about them.

"Yes," Ljörn responded, his voice low like Alfrir's.

"Look at the man's helmet," his brother said. "Nice find, no?"

The warrior he was talking about was wearing a helmet. It was one of those English helmets, with the cheek armour and the brass lining.

"I never seen one like it," Alfrir added.

As they talked, Hjalvir stood up and paced around the room. He stopped by the sea-facing window and peered out into the ocean. He was worried about the same thing Ljörn was worried about.

"Where are those fools?" Hjalvir said. "They were behind us!"

Hjalvir looked away from the window and scanned the various people in the shelter. Ljörn instantly knew what he was thinking and hoped it wasn't going to be him. Hjalvir skipped all the women and children, and the men who were too weak to step out at this time. Then his gaze landed on a particular one.

The man, whom Hjalvir had seemed to choose, was dressed in the thickest amount of clothing Ljörn had ever seen, twice as much as he would bother to wear. Dressed in a bear cloak without the head, a dark brown tunic he was (although the dim made it seem black), his long brown hair was like that of Alfrir's, except with glory. Ljörn didn't like him already.

"I don't remember you joining me. You are called...?" Hjalvir asked, impressed at the man's boldness to wear so much.

The man raised his head, eyes locking onto Hjalvir's. "Ingólfr," the man said.

"Ingólfr," Hjalvir repeated. "You seem prepared. Find out what's happening to the second ship."

Ingólfr bowed his head once. He left the hall, leaving it quiet again.

Sága stood, closing the book she was reading. She went to Hjalvir and talked to him in a quiet voice that Ljörn couldn't hear. After a bit of talking, she turned to everyone else in the room.

"I have a tale to tell!" Sága announced. The chatter quieted down, and the warriors, who were still awake, turned their attention to her. She pulled her chair closer to the hearth, sitting down as she continued. "I announce to you all! Draugrinn ór Mínu Minni, the tale of which Jóki, he and Yngvarr..."

"Draugrinn..." The word echoed in Ljörn's mind. He then felt ill, reminded of an unsavoury past. He quickly stood from where he sat. "S-sorry, I... I feel ill," he stammered, making himself an excuse to leave. He grabbed his shield and hastily made for the front door. Someone shouted at him to come back, but he ignored them.

<!-- SCENARIO 2: Outside !-->
The grass was still swaying in the wind when Ljörn came out. The rain, now lightly showering, made a rustling sound in the grass. The moon was the only light source, making the landscape hauntingly beautiful. But despite the prettiness of the land, he began to feel like he was being followed. He breathed heavily. He looked left and right, but no matter how hard he looked, there wasn't a single sign of danger.

A distinctive rustle came from the tall grass. His eyes darted to the bush, but he saw nothing in it.

A voice questioned him. "What are you doing?"

Ljörn looked to the side and flinched. Ingólfr had returned from his scouting mission, and is now standing before him.

"I felt ill," Ljörn lied.

"You should be sleeping then," Ingólfr responded. His tone didn't carry any suspicion.

Ljörn was going to say he couldn't fall asleep because of his lack of defence, but when he opened his mouth to speak, he heard movement in the bushes again. They sharply turned, eyes searching and scanning the grass from which the sound came. He was sure this time it wasn't the rain or the wind.

The door opened with a slight creak. "Ljörn, what are you-" Alfrir stopped himself as he saw what they were looking at.

<!-- SCENARIO 3: Wolves !-->

A wolf was peering out from the grass, dangerously close to the three. It slowly made a step out of the bush, closer to the two men. Its fur was light grey, with dark tips; and cunning eyes, but not cunning like evil.

"Shoo!" Ingólfr said, attempting to make the wolf leave. It didn't go away.

Another wolf trotted by and stopped to a halt next to the other wolf. The two wolves had the same fur colour and the same snout shape. They realised what was happening. "Go inside, now," Ingólfr urged.

Ljörn backed away, then turned and pushed the door open. Ingólfr came in too, and they shut the door with a slam. Then it rattled, and the sound of an exhale from the foot of the door. Ljörn held the door shut.

"So you return!" Hjalvir was standing up, looming behind the hearthfire. He glared at Ljörn like a traitor, his voice grown stern. Sága wasn't telling a story anymore. She was quiet again, looking confusedly at Ljörn and Ingólfr.

Ljörn shifted uncomfortably. "I..." he trailed off, not knowing how to continue. Ingólfr spoke up with the greater problem in his mind. "We're surrounded by wolves," he reported. "A whole pack of them, I suppose."

Ljörn peeked out the slim window. Sure enough, there they still were, going round the longhouse as if looking for an entrance. One approached the window and smelled it. He drew his seax and thrusted through, but missed when the wolf recoiled.

"One of you two tell me, who led them here?" Hjalvir said frustratingly. He then faced Ljörn, suspicion getting to him. "Did you?"

"No," he said.

"Father, he means no harm," Sága said. "I think he is only cursed. Back at our village, I saw him panic at the sight of a guard at eve, like he had seen a ghost."

"I see nothing curse-like about him," Hjalvir argued. "And that means he may be an outlaw!"

Ljörn was taken aback by the accusation. "They smelled us here," he protested, trying to make him see reason.

Hjalvir stared at Ljörn. He slowly regained his calm with their explanations. "Fine," he muttered. "But if this happens again, I'll have you done!"

The room quieted down. All Ljörn could hear were the hearth, the rain, and several people's snores and chatter. He looked at Hjalvir to make sure there wasn't going to be any more strife.

Hjalvir turned to Ingólfr, his voice lowering. "So, did you find the ship I asked?" he said.

"I couldn't see it," Ingólfr said. "I watched even when the fog cleared."

Hjalvir paused for a moment as he thought of what to do with them. He took a look at Alfrir, then Ljörn and Ingólfr. "You three, go rest," Hjalvir said, dismissing them.

That night, Ljörn laid next to the wall away from the windows. He slept lightly, still unable to get the defencelessness out of his mind. And the cold of the night didn't help.
