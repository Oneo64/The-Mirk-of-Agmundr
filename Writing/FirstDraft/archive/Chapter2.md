# Chapter 2: The Völva
<!-- SCENARIO 1: Meal !-->
A pot sat upon the hearth, boiling softly. As Ljörn waited for the meal to cook, he listened to the ghostly sound of the wind blowing past the windows. He avoided sitting near them, as the cold would have worsened his already wet clothing. But now with his scabbard by his side, he felt more at ease. As long as he had some protection beside him (his seax wasn’t quite enough), he wouldn't feel anxious.

Alfrir was beside Ljörn. He always sat like that when he wasn't wistful. He kept glancing at the group of well-dressed men, as if he were thinking to talk about them. "See them?" Alfrir started, whispering. He nodded in their direction.

Ljörn looked at the people his brother was talking about. "Yes," he muttered.

"Look at the man's helmet," his brother said. "Nice find, no?"

The warrior he was talking about was wearing a helmet. It was one of those English helmets, with the cheek armour and the brass lining.

"I never seen one like it," Alfrir added.

Their small talk died down. A moment later, the pot began to emit a nice aroma. The stew was a combination of goat milk, eggs, and some of the dried fish they had brought. When the stew in the pot was done, everyone in the room took turns and filled their bowls with some of it.

Ljörn returned to his seat, his hand with a bowl of the stew. He was hungry for a meal that wasn't dried salted fish, even though he knew the stew had the fish from the boat.

"Finally, food that isn't fish!" Alfrir said, sitting on his box with his bowl. "Smells fine too, don't you think?"

Ljörn wasn't as satisfied as his brother. He was looking into his. The stew was milky white with a bit of yellow from the yolk. "There's still fish in the bowl," he said.

"Yes, but this one's got eggs," Alfrir said.

Then Hjalvir stood up, walking to the end of the hearth. He waited for everyone to quiet down and turn their heads to him. He raised his bowl and bellowed, "Friends, before we start our dinner, hear me dearly!"

Ljörn looked at Hjalvir. He hadn't started eating, but wasn't expecting there to be an announcement.

Hjalvir continued, "Far from Iceland we have sailed! We are here, the first men to see a new world! And Þórr, he has seen our struggle, and has given this warm soup to us, now we can relish in it!"

There was a cheer, and they began. It was warm and tasted different, and the chunks of fish were at the bottom. Ljörn quickly ate it all.

Once all the throng were finished, the room quieted down again. Bowls were put away, and Ljörn also put his back into his box. After eating that stew, he had a half-full belly, and that was enough.

Relaxing from the rough days of rowing and sailing in bad weather, he leaned back a little more. Now that he was on this new land, there was certainly no going back. His gaze began to wander. He glanced at the men Alfrir talked about earlier. They had full hauberks, unlike him, who only had a byrnie.

His gaze strayed to the hearth. The firewood smouldered, the warmth of their colour flickering between red and orange. He felt the heat of the flame on his skin. Watching the fire dance, he let his mind wander.

*A burning house appeared in Ljörn’s imagination. It was the home of Kolr, who was the blacksmith who made his sword. He was back in Álahringr! Kicking down the door, he ran in to find him, searching the room. Kolr was gone. He couldn't find him.*

*A smouldering plank dropped from the ceiling, and he flinched. He jumped out of the blazing house and raised his shield as he saw an archer release an arrow towards him. But he was too slow. It struck his shield-arm's shoulder and he fell backwards.*

*Ljörn saw a foe, armoured and his face dark, approaching him, brandishing a long axe. He tried to stand up, but his arm was weak, and with a crack, his shield broke into two by the man’s axe blow.*

*The foe advanced towards Ljörn. His shield was broken in his hand. His spear was dropped out of reach. His sword was still unsheathed. His foe stood over him and raised his weapon, ready to strike him dead.*

*Then, the attacker cleaved his axe towards him, but Ljörn raised his shield again, this time the weapon bouncing off his shield's boss, deflecting it to the side.*

*Ljörn took his chance, and he pulled his seax out and lobbed it towards the man’s face. The man flinched and took a step back, but the knife didn’t land. Ljörn dropped his shield and was just about to flee, but then...*

Ljörn jolted and squirmed as if trying to scatter back to his feet. His hand shot to his seax.

"Ljörn, stop that!" Alfrir whispered. He put both hands on Ljörn's shoulders, keeping him from squirming. He hadn't taken it out. A few people glanced at them, then went back to minding their own business.

Ljörn was breathing heavily. He looked at Alfrir. "Nightmare," he lied. But even with Alfrir now thinking he had a nightmare, that didn’t calm him down. His gaze darted to both sides, then to the windows, and the door.

"Don't lie," Alfrir said. "You had the same thing on the boat. I know you were awake, so don't fool me now."

Ljörn glanced at Alfrir. He was upset, but he didn't defend himself. "Get off me," he sharply said. His heart was beating like he was sprinting a moment ago.

Alfrir hesitated, then sat back down.

Ljörn's mind started to wander, and the first thing that came into his mind was what he had just seen. Putting those thoughts down, he let himself wander in his thoughts again.

But those thoughts drifted back into his mind. He tried to forget about them, but then he'd find himself thinking about them again. Unable to forget what he had seen, his paranoia started to grow on him. Then, he looked at Alfrir and spoke up. "The seeress," he said. "Where is she?"

"I... she's outside," Alfrir said. "What for?"

Ljörn didn't answer him. His gaze searched the room for the seeress, but she wasn't there. Without a fuss, he stood up and slung his shield around his back. He took an unlit torch stick and stuck it in the hearth. When it caught fire, he held it up and left the longhouse.

<!-- SCENARIO 3: Outside and the volva !-->

The cold breeze hit his face when he pushed the door open. He closed the door behind him as gently as he could, but his anxiety didn't make it easy. The rain, now lightly showering, made a rustling sound in the grass. The moon was the only light source, making the landscape hauntingly beautiful. But despite the prettiness of the land, he began to feel like he was being followed. He breathed heavily. His torch gave him light so he could see, its flames warm and flickering. He looked left and right, but no matter how hard he looked, there wasn't a single sign of danger. But when he glanced over to the forest again, he froze.

There was a pack of wolves. About a dozen of them moved through the trees and shrubs, ominously trotting in the haze. They stopped in their tracks, noticing him.

Panicking, Ljörn reached for his sword, but paused before he could pull it out.

The wolves hesitated and continued on, ignoring Ljörn even when he was alone out in the open. Perhaps it was the fire-torch he was holding that discouraged them.

Ljörn cautiously watched as they ran off, disappearing into the wild. Now that they were gone, he turned to face the shore, hoping he would find her there instead. And as he slowly walked there and reached the edge of the meadow, he saw the völva.

There she was on the sand, gazing out into the ocean as if she were consulting the gods on the weather. She was in a dark dress and a deer pelt cloak. And the most shamanic thing about her was a crooked staff that she held with several beads and skulls hanging from the end. In front of her, there was a small fire that burned sticks and grass gathered from around.

When Ljörn saw her, he hesitated. He thought he felt a bit of fear boil in his heart, but ignored it and approached her. As he neared her, he saw that the skulls on her staff were of ravens and owls, and the beads were all made of the richest ambers he had seen.

And then Ljörn said, "I seek our woes."

The völva turned around. She was elderly, at least twice as old as he was. She wore the claw of a bear on her head like a necklace, and the real necklace she wore around her neck was strung full of fangs and talons.

"Do you?" the völva questioned him. "To seek the woes of this land, this stead, or the lead?"

Confused, Ljörn didn't know what she was talking about.

"Well?" she asked.

Ljörn wasn't sure what he was paranoid of, so he said, "The woes of this land."

"Then you must pay," she said. She pointed at a nearby bush. "Bring me the head and tail!"

Ljörn, still confused, looked at the bush. Was there something in it? He picked up a large pebble and threw it into the bush. Nothing came out.

He put his torch down, drew his sword, and inched closer to it. He held his shield ready for anything that could come out. The breeze seemed cooler the closer he got to the bush.

A blur sprang out of it and hit Ljörn's shield! He flinched and took a step back, looking over his shield to see what had hit it. Then, he saw a long creature. It was covered in scales and had a lizard-like head. It had beady eyes and its pupils were slits. It looked like Jörmungandr. But it was smaller, like a rodent. It hissed at him and coiled, warning him to stay back.

He was disgusted. He had never seen a creature like it before, even with his experience of exploring forests in his homeland. Not sure whether to hit it with his sword or not, he picked his torch up again and lobbed it at the creature with all his might, hitting it right.

But that made the creature more aggressive. It slithered after him. He swung his sword, but the creature jumped at him again and held onto his shield. With a surprise, he dropped it onto the sand and backed away. 

Ljörn grabbed a handful of sand and threw it all over his dropped shield and the creature. Right after that, he closed in and with a cleave, he chopped it in half.

It writhed, squirmed, and came off his shield. He then picked his shield up and smote the creature, killing it.

Ljörn stepped back to better see it again. He slowly approached it and gave it a nudge with his sword, making sure it was dead. "What is this...?" he whispered to himself as he bent down to look at it closely. He felt an urge to stand up so he wasn't so close to it, but he resisted. This was the creature that he needed to take parts from. He put away his sword and drew a knife. He cut its head and tail, leaving the body on the shore.

Ljörn returned to the völva. He held the creature's appendages in a way so that more blood wouldn't get onto his hands. "Here," he quietly said, offering them to her.

The völva took the creature's appendages and said,  "Ah, the snake's head and tail!"

Ljörn then realised what he had slain was a snake. He glanced back at the headless, tailless snake body he left beside the bush which it came out of.

Taking the head and tail, the völva tossed them into the fire before her. As they caught fire and quickly turned to ash, she looked into the sky, and her eyes went blank. She began to talk in tongues, chanting some old language he had never heard or read before. "Nerþuz, Þunraz, Wōðanaz, Frawjaz, jūz mek geb witamaz þanei izwiz wissēz, jūz mek lētō auk spellą! Ek hit blōtą geldō, swa jūz mek frōdī auk Lernas waiwanunz, auk jūz hes walanunz manō!"

The völva’s voice became more like the whisper of a raspy old man. She was now speaking cryptically, but this time, Ljörn understood.

*Goblet one may find,*

*sunken in bushes' hind;*

*waken one will be,*

*a corpse none shall see.*

Ljörn was afraid. He had already forgotten what he was so paranoid of before meeting her, and now he had taken several steps back when she had begun her spell. And she is still going, her speech back to that ancient tongue.

The völva finished her chanting and ended her trance-like state. She stared into Ljörn's eyes and asked one word. "Enough?"

"Yes, yes," Ljörn blurted out. He shot her a nervous smile and quickly left her alone on the beach.

Ljörn hurried back to the longhouse, eager to get away from the völva as soon as possible. But when he stopped at the front door of the house, he thought back on what the völva said. He could only remember the part where she said, "waken one will be, a corpse none shall see." He shivered.

Ljörn looked at the shore again. The völva snuffed her fire out and started to return to the longhouse. Looking to the side, Hjalvir's ship was tied to a stake in the ground by its mast. It sat there, lifted from the sand and placed back down by the water.
