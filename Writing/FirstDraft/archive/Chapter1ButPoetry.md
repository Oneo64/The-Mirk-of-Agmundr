# Chapter 1: Nine Hundred and Twenty Two
Splash and spray, foam falls laid,
longboats fare full sails made;
seen at sea no birds brave,
a skull hangs with a sway.

A blond man whom called Ljörn,
sits on his box nane thought;
sees his iron necklace forn,
cold hands linger in cloak.

Rain will fall lands in boat,
no scent but sky of lurk;
Vegvísir lets flood not,
or harm none from storm's mirk.

Hjalvir he sees the land,
a stripe of grass and sand;
he turns and tells them row,
but rain starts tempest grow.
