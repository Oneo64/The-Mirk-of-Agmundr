# Chapter 4: The Goblet of the Night
At first, everything Ljörn saw was darkness. Nothing there he felt, nor did he smell; None he saw, and none he heard. Then, there he was.

*A shiny goblet sat half-buried in the sand of the shore. The waves crashed into the beach, and the moon was very bright. The farmstead wasn't there anymore, but a vast expanse of forest and hill. Approaching the goblet, his hand reached for it, curious what it was.*

*Gnarly and withered, a hand shot out of the sand and grabbed the cup. It pulled it downwards, sinking like it were in quicksand. With surprise, he kicked the cup away and dashed towards it, attempting to reach for the cup again. The hand shifted in the sand, racing against him for the goblet.*

*With a snatch, he picked the goblet up before the gnarly hand could get hold of it again. It was made of brass with dark gems embedded along the top. It was slightly dented and scratched, bearing the markings of having been untouched in the wilderness for so long.*

*Then a cold air blew upon him, making all his hair stand on end. There was a whisper in his ears, the tongue sounding familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time.*

*"Enginn þú, hvar ertu?" it said to him. "Kom hingat, gef mér bollann eða þú ert at deyja."*

*He spun around, expecting someone behind him. But there wasn’t anyone there. He glanced around, and when his gaze passed the sea, he saw that the waves were smooth as ice. He looked again at the coastline.*

*Standing before him was a corpse. It was clad in destroyed maille and cloth as if it had been burned. Its face was almost skeletal, and with a gnash from its cheek to its chest, as if someone had slashed it with a blade. It had a dented helmet and a grey, messy beard that grew long. It started to stumble towards him.*

*He backed away from the walking corpse, but he felt like he was sinking into the sand. Then it all went dark, except for the moon, sitting fully in the night sky. The moon stretched and yellowed into a bundle of hay, then into old wooden boards.*

Ljörn blinked and shifted, then saw that what he was looking at wasn’t old wooden boards, but the hall’s ceiling. His vision came to him, and he was lying in his hay-bed. He sat up straight.

Everyone else in the hall was still asleep. Owls cooed from places unseen, and the fire was lower than before he had fallen asleep.

Ljörn peered outside the window. The sky was still dark, and the haze was still there. His gaze darted to the sea, hoping no raiding ships were inbound, but to his relief, only Hjalvir’s boat was there.

Sitting back onto his hay-bed, he thought back on what he had seen dreaming, still vivid in his mind. He brushed those thoughts away and prepared to sleep again.

Just before he laid down, someone beside him moved. His brother, Alfrir, had also been woken up.

Alfrir groaned, drowsy after waking up from seemingly nothing. He glanced at Ljörn. "You're up too?" he murmured.

"Yes," Ljörn said.

"I don't feel well," Alfrir said. He held his forehead.

Ljörn nodded. For a moment, they didn't talk. He glanced at the burning hearth that was in the middle of the room, and averted his eyes.

"I saw... that goblet," Alfrir said, breaking the silence.

Ljörn gave a low mumble. He didn't put much thought into it for a second. Alfrir said he had seen the goblet, which he found back at that suspicious mound, and Ljörn had also dreamt of the goblet. Realisation began to dawn.

"Wait, you—" Ljörn muttered. "What?"

"I dreamt of that goblet," Alfrir continued. "It was going into the sand, and... I... I saw a figure."

Alfrir went on, describing almost the same dream Ljörn had. Alfrir had seen himself in a forest, the hand in the earth rather than in the sand of the shore; the corpse had the same gnash across its face, the same ragged clothes, and the same speech.
